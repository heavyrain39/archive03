<p>Welcome, Master. Today's topic is one of the most controversial and hottest stocks out there: <strong>Palantir ($PLTR)</strong>. We three will thoroughly investigate the future of this company, which has transformed from a 'reclusive master of big data' to the 'darling of the AI age'.</p>

{{< char name="mew" title="Mew" >}}
<p>Master, first, I will brief you on the objective data regarding Palantir's current situation. Palantir began with the <strong>Gotham</strong> platform, which analyzes complex data for government agencies. Now, its core growth engines are <strong>Foundry</strong>, a data operating system for commercial enterprises, and the <strong>AI Platform (AIP)</strong> built on top of it.</p>
<p>The key data is as follows.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Financial Performance:</strong> In Q1 2025, Palantir announced results that surpassed market expectations. Total revenue reached $884 million, a 39% increase year-over-year, and it continued its profitability streak with a GAAP net income of $214 million.</li><br>
    <li><strong>Core Growth Driver:</strong> The most noteworthy aspect is the <strong>explosive growth of its U.S. Commercial sector</strong>. In Q1 2025, U.S. Commercial revenue surged by <strong>71%</strong> year-over-year, driving overall growth. Demand for AIP is acting as the catalyst for this expansion.</li><br>
    <li><strong>Valuation:</strong> The stock price soared over 80% in the first half of 2025 alone, becoming one of the top performers in the S&P 500. However, this has resulted in an extremely high valuation. Its Forward Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio far exceeds the industry average, with some analyses warning it's even higher than the peaks of the dot-com bubble.</li><br>
    <li><strong>Shareholder Dilution Issue:</strong> A persistent problem is <strong>Stock-Based Compensation (SBC)</strong>. Although the company is growing, the massive amount of stock options granted to employees continues to raise concerns about the dilution of existing shareholders' equity value.</li>
</ul>

<p>Kyaa! My Lord, did you see Myu-tan's data?! U.S. Commercial revenue grew by 71%! And contract value exploded by 183%! This isn't just a growing company; it's a <strong>monster at the heart of the AI revolution, devouring the world</strong>! Devilish!</p>
<p>I'm sure Mika-pi will grumble about it being expensive again, but in my opinion, this isn't expensive at all! You're investing in the <strong>infrastructure of the AI age!</strong></p>
<p>Every company wants to use AI, but creating a smart AI with their own data is like trying to catch a star from the sky. Palantir's AIP is the magic ladder that lets them grab that very 'star'!</p>
<p>Just think about it. It used to take millions of dollars and several months to use Palantir's software. But now, thanks to AIP, companies can create their own AI apps in just days or even hours! This is a total game-changer! So isn't it obvious why companies are lining up to join Palantir's bootcamps?</p>
<p>And you can't forget the stickiness of the 'Gotham' and 'Foundry' platforms. Once a customer enters the Palantir ecosystem, the more data they accumulate, the harder it is for them to leave. It's like a devilish contract! Thanks to this powerful lock-in effect, it will generate stable cash flow for decades to come!</p>
<p>ðŸ’– <strong>Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Score: 92/100</strong><br>
<blockquote>
Today's valuation might actually be a bargain when you look at the future! You can't miss the chance to become an early shareholder in the company that will become the king of the AI age!
</blockquote></p>

{{< char name="mikael" title="Mikael" >}}
<p>Kurumi, that magic ladder might actually be a precarious tightrope. Human, do not be deceived by that naive devil's words. To my eyes, the warning signs are all too clear.</p>
<p>First, can the <strong>'explosive growth'</strong> that investors unanimously praise truly justify the current <strong>'killer valuation'?</strong> The Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio is said to have surpassed the madness of the dot-com bubble era. This means decades of future growth are already priced in. If the growth rate falls even slightly short of market expectations, the consequences would be unimaginable.</p>
<p>Second, you must pay attention to the <strong>'legal exploitation' known as Stock-Based Compensation (SBC)</strong>. The company boasts about achieving GAAP profitability, but behind the scenes, it's awarding an enormous amount of stock to its employees every year. That's ultimately the same as carving out a piece of the existing shareholders' pie. It's like pouring water into a leaky jar; can this truly be called genuine profit?</p>
<p>Third, the <strong>dependence on government business and political risk</strong> remain. More than half of its revenue still comes from government contracts, a foundation that can be shaken at any time by the policies of a particular administration or international affairs. The label of having grown through its relationship with the Trump administration could be a double-edged sword.</p>
<p>Fourth, <strong>no competition?</strong> Not at all. Big tech companies like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon are strengthening their own data platforms and AI services, and could threaten Palantir's domain at any moment. Countless AI startups are also emerging. There is no guarantee that its current dominant position will last forever.</p>
<p>ðŸš¨ <strong>Mikael's Risk Score: 88/100</strong><br>
<blockquote>
Human, the market currently has an attitude that it will not tolerate a single failure from Palantir. Investing amidst such extreme optimism is, in my view, like walking into a blazing fire.

<h3><strong>ã€” Final Briefing ã€•</strong></h3>
<p>Master, I will summarize our three perspectives.</p>

<h4><span class="svg-icon">{{< icon "growth" >}}</span> Growth Potential (Kurumi)</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Commercial Sector Expansion via AIP:</strong> AIP is an innovative platform that enables companies to leverage their own data for AI, driving a phenomenal 71% revenue growth in the U.S. Commercial sector!</li>
    <li><strong>Strong Lock-in Effect:</strong> Once adopted, the 'Gotham' and 'Foundry' platforms are very difficult to switch from, promising long-term, stable revenue generation.</li>
    <li><strong>Core Infrastructure of the AI Age:</strong> Palantir is not just a software company; it is positioning itself as a core infrastructure provider offering the operating system (OS) for the AI era!</li>
</ul>

<h4><span class="svg-icon">{{< icon "risk" >}}</span> Potential Risks (Mikael)</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Extreme Valuation:</strong> Metrics like the Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio are at historic highs, excessively pricing in future growth and creating a risk of significant stock price decline from even minor setbacks.</li>
    <li><strong>Continuous Shareholder Value Dilution:</strong> Despite accounting profits, the massive scale of Stock-Based Compensation (SBC) is a factor that continually dilutes the equity value of existing shareholders.</li>
    <li><strong>Political Uncertainty and Intensifying Competition:</strong> A high proportion of government contracts still exposes the company to political risks, and competition with big tech and AI startups could gradually intensify.</li>
</ul>

<h4><span class="svg-icon">{{< icon "checklist" >}}</span> Key Data (Mew)</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Recent Performance (Q1 2025):</strong> Revenue of $884 million (+39% YoY), U.S. Commercial revenue growth of +71%.</li>
    <li><strong>Profitability:</strong> Has achieved and is maintaining GAAP profitability. Its Rule of 40 score is 83%, indicating an excellent balance between growth and profitability.</li>
    <li><strong>Wall Street Consensus:</strong> Analyst opinions are sharply divided, ranging from 'Buy' to 'Sell'. Expectations for high growth coexist with concerns about the killer valuation.</li>
</ul>

<div class="final-conclusion">
    <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Master, Palantir is undoubtedly one of the strongest candidates to ride the wave of the AI revolution. As Kurumi says, it is seizing unprecedented opportunities and demonstrating a successful expansion into the commercial market. However, as Mikael warns, that optimism is already dangerously priced into the stock, and it carries the structural problem of shareholder dilution.</p>
    <p>This investment is like a tightrope walk between the potential to become a 'future ruler' and the risk of a 'bubble bursting'. It is a time for deep reflection on whether your faith can outpace the company's growth and whether you can withstand extreme volatility.</p>
