<p>Master, today's topic is the hot potato of the crypto market: <strong>Solana ($SOL)</strong>. It's more famous by its nickname, the 'Ethereum Killer'. Wielding its formidable speed and low fees as weapons, it's challenging the dominance of Ethereum. Let's examine what it might look like in the second half of 2025.</p>

{{< char name="mew" title="Mew" >}}
<p>Master, first, I will brief you on the objective data regarding Solana's current situation. As of August 2, 2025, Solana is one of the most watched Layer 1 blockchains in the cryptocurrency market.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Price and Market Cap:</strong> Currently, Solana ($SOL) is trading between approximately $162 and $168. Its market capitalization is around $87.6 billion to $90.7 billion, ranking it 6th among all cryptocurrencies.</li><br>
    <li><strong>Technical Performance:</strong> Solana's most significant feature is its overwhelming transaction processing speed. Theoretically, it can handle over 65,000 TPS (transactions per second), and even on the live network, it routinely records hundreds to thousands of TPS, far surpassing Ethereum's approximately 15-30 TPS. The average transaction fee is also extremely low, at less than $0.01.</li><br>
    <li><strong>Core Upgrade - Firedancer:</strong> Solana is currently in the process of gradually implementing a new validator client called 'Firedancer.' Developed by Jump Crypto, this client aims to maximize network throughput and enhance stability, with a full mainnet launch targeted for the end of 2025. In test environments, it has already demonstrated performance exceeding 1 million TPS.</li><br>
    <li><strong>Ecosystem Metrics:</strong> In 2025, the Solana ecosystem has grown explosively. The number of daily active addresses reached 2.2 million, surpassing Ethereum, and its decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volume accounted for a staggering 81% of the entire crypto market in 2024. Its Total Value Locked (TVL) in DeFi is around $8 billion to $9 billion, ranking second only to Ethereum.</li><br>
    <li><strong>Network Stability:</strong> In the past, Solana faced criticism for its stability after experiencing several network outages. The most recent major outage was in February 2024, but it has shown relatively stable performance throughout 2025.</li><br>
    <li><strong>Decentralization Metrics:</strong> The number of Solana validators is approximately 3,248 and continues to grow. The 'Nakamoto Coefficient,' which represents the minimum number of validators that would have to collude to halt the network, is 21. While lower than Ethereum's, it maintains a respectable level compared to other major blockchains.</li>
</ul>

<p>Wow! my Lord! Just look at this data! This isn't just 'growth,' it's a 'mega-explosion'! The 'Ethereum Killer' nickname is well-deserved! Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Score: 120/100! Devilish!</p>
<p>First, <strong>speed and fees! This is the real game-changer!</strong> On Ethereum, doing anything costs a coffee's worth in fees and takes forever. But on Solana, everything is done in the blink of an eye for less than the price of a gumball! This is the experience that makes regular users feel that blockchain is actually 'usable'! It's only natural that people are flocking to it!</p>
<p>Second, <strong>just look at that blazing ecosystem!</strong> All sorts of memecoins are blowing up on Solana! This might look like mere 'speculation,' but it's actually a tremendous source of energy that brings in a massive number of new users and vitalizes the network! And that's not all! DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network) projects like Helium are actually changing the world on top of Solana! This is proof that it has real 'utility'!</p>
<p>Third, <strong>the ace in the hole, 'Firedancer,' is coming!</strong> It's already this fast, but once Firedancer is fully equipped, the network performance could be several, or even tens of times, better than it is now! This goes beyond just getting faster; it means that new kinds of applications that Ethereum can't even dream of could be born on Solana!</p>
<p>my Lord! Mika-pi will probably bring up past network outages again, but that's ancient history! As they say, what doesn't kill you makes you stronger, and Solana is much tougher now! Hesitating now is like kicking away your chance to board a speeding rocket!</p>

<p>Kurumi, your excited voice sounds like an alarm bell to me. Human, the louder the celebration, the more calmly you must assess the situation. Behind Solana's dazzling lights, several dark shadows are lurking.</p>
<p>First, <strong>you must not forget the original sin of 'network instability.'</strong> You say, "It's fine now"? The frequent network outages of the past stemmed from fundamental issues in Solana's architecture. The history of the network halting whenever traffic surged could repeat itself at any time. They claim Firedancer is the solution, but betting the network's fate on a technology that has not yet been fully vetted is a dangerous gamble.</p>
<p>Second, <strong>the illusion of 'decentralization.'</strong> As Mew's data showed, a Nakamoto Coefficient of 21 means that just 21 validators colluding can stop the network. It is far more centralized than Ethereum. This is a clear weakness where the network can be controlled by the influence of a few. Can this truly be called a decentralized blockchain in its truest sense?</p>
<p>Third, <strong>an ecosystem like a sandcastle. Is it truly sustainable?</strong> It's undeniable that a significant portion of Solana's high transaction volume comes from the memecoin craze. Such trends are bound to recede like the tide. Will it be able to maintain the same level of active users and transaction volume after the trend dies down? Growth that relies on short-term frenzy rather than fundamental value is always risky.</p>
<p>Fourth, <strong>institutional interest, like ETFs, is still focused on Bitcoin and Ethereum.</strong> While there is talk of a Solana ETF, it is still in its very early stages. This means there are many hurdles to overcome before serious capital from traditional finance flows in.</p>
<p>I would rate the risk score of this investment at <strong>85 points</strong>. Dazzled by its impressive speed, you must not forget that you are standing on a high cliff where one misstep could lead to a fall.</p>

<h3><strong>〔 Final Briefing 〕</strong></h3>
<p>Master, I will summarize the conversation we three have had.</p>

<h4><span class="svg-icon">{{< icon "growth" >}}</span> Growth Potential (Kurumi)</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Overwhelming Performance:</strong> Its incomparable speed and low fees compared to Ethereum are the most powerful weapons for mass user adoption!</li>
    <li><strong>Explosive Ecosystem:</strong> Users and developers are flocking from various sectors like memecoins, DeFi, and DePIN, maximizing the network effect!</li>
    <li><strong>Firedancer Upgrade:</strong> The upcoming Firedancer upgrade has the potential to elevate Solana's performance to another level, creating a gap that competitors cannot bridge.</li>
</ul>

<h4><span class="svg-icon">{{< icon "risk" >}}</span> Potential Risks (Mikael)</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Network Stability Issues:</strong> The multiple network outages in the past raise questions about Solana's fundamental reliability.</li>
    <li><strong>Relatively Low Decentralization:</strong> Compared to Ethereum, it has fewer validators and a lower Nakamoto Coefficient, making it more vulnerable to centralization and censorship risks.</li>
    <li><strong>Dependence on Speculative Demand:</strong> The fact that a significant portion of the current high network activity relies on the unsustainable memecoin craze is a point of concern.</li>
</ul>

<h4><span class="svg-icon">{{< icon "checklist" >}}</span> Key Data (Mew)</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Current Price/Market Cap:</strong> Approx. $162-$168, 6th overall by market cap.</li>
    <li><strong>Performance Metrics:</strong> High speed of several thousand TPS and low fees of less than $0.01.</li>
    <li><strong>Key Variable:</strong> The successful deployment of the 'Firedancer' client, scheduled for the end of 2025.</li>
    <li><strong>Market Sentiment:</strong> There is a sharp divide between high expectations for its technical potential and explosive ecosystem growth, and concerns over past network instability and centralization.</li>
</ul>

<div class="final-conclusion">
    <p>Master, Solana is an investment that perfectly illustrates the phrase 'high risk, high return.' As Kurumi says, its overwhelming technical performance and blazing ecosystem show it has enough potential to become a game-changer that could alter the future of cryptocurrency. However, as Mikael warns, behind that lies serious questions related to stability and decentralization, which are tied to the fundamental philosophy of blockchain.</p>
    <p>Investing in Solana is like betting 'yes' to the question, 'Will it overcome its past failures to become a true rival to Ethereum?' Depending on Master's risk tolerance and depth of faith in the technology, this investment could be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for some, or a dangerous game with fire for others.</p>
