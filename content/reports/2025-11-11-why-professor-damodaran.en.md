summary: "Investment guru Professor Aswath Damodaran warns that while the 2025 U.S. stock market is indeed overvalued, trying to time the market based on this fact is likely to fail. Historical data proves that market timing strategies underperform simple buy-and-hold, and when transaction costs and psychological traps are considered, the losses are even greater."

<p>Master, today I've brought a blog post from October 2025 by the legendary valuation guru, Professor Aswath Damodaran of NYU's Stern School of Business. The title is <a href="https://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2025/10/a-fairly-highly-valued-market-fed-chair.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>"Is the U.S. Stock Market Overvalued?"</strong></a> but the core message is simple. <strong>"The market looks expensive, yes. But if you try to time your buying and selling based on that knowledge... you'll lose."</strong> This is the curse of what investors call 'Market Timing,' a trap that's all too easy to fall into.</p>

{{< char name="mew" title="Mew" >}}
<p>Master, first, I will summarize the 2025 market situation as analyzed by Professor Damodaran.</p>

<p><strong>The State of the U.S. Stock Market in 2025:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>S&P 500:</strong> Rose 13.7% in the first nine months of 2025. It fell 14.3% in the first quarter before strongly rebounding in the second and third quarters.</li><br>
<li><strong>Nasdaq:</strong> Rose 17.3% over the same period. It had dropped by as much as 21.3% from its low on April 8 before making a full recovery.</li><br>
<li><strong>The Dominance of the Mag 7:</strong> Seven mega-cap tech stocks—Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Google, Amazon, Meta, and Tesla—account for 30.35% of the total U.S. stock market capitalization. A staggering 52.4% of the market's gains in 2025 came from these seven companies.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Overvaluation Indicators Presented by Professor Damodaran:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>PE ratio (Price-to-Earnings Ratio):</strong> The current PE, normalized PE, and Shiller PE are all at historic highs. Excluding the dot-com bubble, they are near their peak.</li><br>
<li><strong>Earnings Yield vs. Treasury Yield:</strong> The stock market's earnings yield is 4%, while the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield is 4.16%. This means stocks are offering a lower yield than bonds. Theoretically, 'risky stocks' should provide a higher return than 'safe Treasuries,' but the situation is inverted.</li><br>
<li><strong>Implied Equity Risk Premium (Implied ERP):</strong> The implied ERP for the S&P 500, as calculated by Professor Damodaran, is 4.01%, which is lower than the average of 4.25% since the 2008 financial crisis. This implies that the market is 'optimistically priced.'</li><br>
<li><strong>Overvaluation Compared to Fair Value:</strong> Applying the historical average earnings yield of 4.25%, the fair value of the S&P 500 would be around 5,940, but the actual index is at 6,800. This analysis suggests it is overvalued by about 12.6%.</li>
</ol>

<p>Looking at this, you might think, "Ah, the market is expensive. Should I sell?" But this is where Professor Damodaran asks the crucial question: <strong>"So what?"</strong></p>

{{< char name="kurumi" title="Kurumi" >}}
<p>Hold on! Looking only at the indicators Myu-tan mentioned, you might think, "I should sell all my stocks and run for the hills!" But I've discovered something important here, My Lord! Devilish!</p>

<p>First, <strong>'expensive' doesn't mean 'it's going to crash,' My Lord!</strong> What Professor Damodaran emphasized is that while the market is overvalued, it doesn't mean "it will crash tomorrow." Think back to 1996 when former Fed Chair Alan Greenspan warned of "Irrational Exuberance." After he said that, the market continued to rise for another 3-4 years! Selling too early means you miss out on huge potential gains!</p>

<p>Second, <strong>99% of market timing attempts fail!</strong> The results of Professor Damodaran's backtest over 100 years of data are shocking. He simulated a strategy of "sell when the Shiller PE is high, buy when it's low." And what were the results? <strong>Over the last 50 years (1975-2024), the market timing strategy reduced annual returns by 0.41%!</strong> You would have been better off just holding a 60% stock + 40% bond portfolio!</p>

<p>Third, <strong>you'll get fleeced by transaction costs and taxes trying to time the market!</strong> The professor didn't even include transaction costs and taxes in his backtest. In reality, you pay a fee every time you buy and sell, and you have to pay capital gains tax, so the actual losses would be much larger! Plus, the psychological stress of deciding "Now's the time to sell!" is priceless!</p>

<p>Fourth, <strong>the real opportunity comes when 'nobody else is buying'!</strong> What Professor Damodaran was implicitly saying is this: while it's theoretically correct to sell when the market looks expensive and buy when it looks cheap, in reality, a market that "looks expensive can keep going up" and one that "looks cheap can keep going down" for years! If you can't endure that pain, you'll end up surrendering at the worst possible time!</p>

<p>💖 <strong>Kurumi's 'Give Up on Timing' Recommendation Score: 90/100</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>My Lord, market timing is an 'impossible dream'! It's 100 times better to spend that time finding good companies to hold for the long term!</p>
</blockquote>

{{< char name="mikael" title="Mikael" >}}
<p>I acknowledge Kurumi's passion... but, Human, I wish to approach this more soberly. What Professor Damodaran was truly warning about isn't just "don't time the market." There's a deeper message hidden here.</p>

<p><strong>First, it's the tragedy of 'knowing, yet being unable to act.'</strong> Professor Damodaran calculated that the market is about 12.6% overvalued. Let's assume he's right. The problem is that no one knows 'when' this overvaluation will correct. A correction could come tomorrow, or it could come in three years. What if the market rises another 20% in the meantime? You end up being an investor who made the "right analysis" but took the "wrong action." This is the meaning behind the saying Professor Damodaran quotes: <strong>"Markets can stay mispriced longer than you can stay solvent."</strong></p>

<p><strong>Second, it's the risk of relying on imperfect indicators.</strong> The PE ratio, Earnings Yield, Implied ERP... all these indicators are based on 'past data.' But the market always prices in the 'future.' What if the AI revolution truly unleashes a productivity boom, and the Mag 7 companies grow at an average of 20% annually for the next 10 years? Today's 'overvaluation' might turn out to be an 'undervaluation' in the future. Conversely, if a recession hits, today's price might not just be expensive, but 'absurdly expensive.' Ultimately, making judgments based solely on indicators is like driving while only looking in the rearview mirror.</p>

<p><strong>Third, it's the trap of behavioral bias.</strong> Look at Professor Damodaran's backtest results again. The fact that the market timing strategy underperformed buy-and-hold by 0.41% annually over 50 years means that, on average, there's 'almost no difference.' But in reality, the problem isn't the average; it's the 'extreme moments.' Those who sold in a panic at the bottom during the 2008 financial crisis or bought in a frenzy at the top during the 2021 meme stock craze didn't lose an average of 0.41%; they lost over 50%. Humans are emotional creatures, making it nearly impossible to execute 'rational timing.'</p>

<p><strong>Fourth, it's the problem of opportunity cost.</strong> The moment an investor attempts to time the market, they pour an immense amount of mental and temporal energy into it. Staring at charts, analyzing economic indicators, listening to expert opinions... But if they had spent that time focusing on their career, spending time with family, or on self-improvement, they could have created far more value. This is what Professor Damodaran really wanted to say: <strong>"Don't waste your life trying to time the market."</strong></p>

<p><strong>Fifth, despite all this, 'complete neglect' is also dangerous.</strong> Kurumi says, "Just hold on!" but I don't entirely agree. Professor Damodaran didn't present "Do nothing" as the best strategy. He offered five possible responses, one of which is <strong>"Change Asset Allocation."</strong> For example, someone who normally maintains a 60% stock + 40% bond portfolio might shift to a more defensive 50% stock + 50% bond allocation if they judge the market to be overvalued. This isn't 'timing'; it's 'risk management.' It's about creating a 'sleep-well-at-night portfolio' through gradual adjustments, not extreme all-in/all-out moves.</p>

<p>🚨 <strong>Mikael's 'Market Timing Risk Level': 95/100</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Human, market timing is a game with a 'less than 5% chance of success.' It's no better than a casino roulette wheel. However, 'mindlessly holding on' is also risky. The key is to avoid extremes and manage risk through asset allocation.</p>
</blockquote>

{{< char name="mew" title="Mew" >}}
<p>Kurumi's and Mikael's opinions diverge in an interesting way. I will now summarize the 'realistic alternatives' proposed by Professor Damodaran.</p>

<p><strong>Professor Damodaran's Five Response Strategies:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Do Nothing:</strong> Maintain your existing asset allocation (e.g., 60% stocks + 40% bonds) and ignore whether the market is expensive or cheap. This is the simplest but psychologically the most difficult strategy.</li><br>
<li><strong>Build Cash:</strong> Keep new incoming money in cash-like assets (short-term Treasuries, MMFs, etc.) instead of stocks, while leaving existing stock holdings untouched. This is a moderate approach to gradually increase a defensive position.</li><br>
<li><strong>Change Asset Allocation:</strong> Shift from a 60% stock + 40% bond portfolio to 50% stocks + 50% bonds, reducing stock exposure and increasing bond exposure. This is also a non-extreme defensive strategy.</li><br>
<li><strong>Buy Protection:</strong> Use derivatives like put options or index futures to prepare for a market downturn. It's like buying 'insurance' while maintaining your existing portfolio. However, if the option premiums are expensive, you could end up losing money.</li><br>
<li><strong>Make Leveraged Bets:</strong> Make large-scale bets on a market decline. This is a strategy of 'hitting the jackpot if the market crashes' through short selling or buying put options, but it's the most aggressive and riskiest method. Professor Damodaran did not recommend this.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>The Shocking Results of the Backtest:</strong><br>
Professor Damodaran simulated various market timing strategies based on the Shiller PE. For example, a rule like, "If the Shiller PE is 25% above its historical median, reduce stock allocation from 60% to 40%; if it's 25% below, increase it to 80%." The results were as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1924-2024 (100 years):</strong> The market timing strategy underperformed by 0.04% annually.</li>
<li><strong>1975-2024 (50 years):</strong> The market timing strategy underperformed by 0.41% annually.</li>
<li><strong>More Aggressive Strategies (based on 10% or 50% deviations from the median):</strong> All resulted in negative returns.</li>
</ul>

<p>In other words, no combination could beat a simple Buy and Hold. The professor even shared the spreadsheet, saying, "If you want to try other combinations, do it yourself," which should be seen as a strong message: "No matter how you try, it won't work."</p>

<p><strong>Professor Damodaran's Conclusion:</strong><br>
<em>"Market timing is a personal choice, and it would be arrogant of me to claim that what does not work for me cannot work for you. If you do make market timing part of your investment philosophy, though, there are three lessons to take away. First, the more you depend on imperfect indicators, the greater the chance that you will be chasing a correction that never comes. Second, the proof that an indicator works is not in a statistical correlation, but in a back-tested, implementable strategy. Third, even with all of this, market timing is noisy and error-prone. In short, markets can stay mispriced longer than you can stay solvent."</em></p>

<h3><strong>〔 Final Briefing 〕</strong></h3>
<p>Master, I will summarize Professor Damodaran's message from our three perspectives.</p>

<h4><span class="svg-icon">{{< icon "growth" >}}</span> Optimistic View (Kurumi): "Giving Up on Timing Is the Answer!"</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Historical Proof:</strong> Over the last 50 years, market timing strategies have returned 0.41% less per year than a simple buy-and-hold strategy!</li>
<li><strong>Transaction Costs and Taxes:</strong> These weren't included in the backtest, but in reality, fees and taxes from buying and selling make the losses even bigger!</li>
<li><strong>The Psychological Trap:</strong> If you can't endure a market that 'looks expensive but keeps rising' for years, you'll eventually surrender at the worst possible moment!</li>
<li><strong>Opportunity Cost:</strong> Instead of wasting time and energy trying to time the market, it's far better to find good companies and hold them for the long term!</li>
</ul>

<h4><span class="svg-icon">{{< icon "risk" >}}</span> Pessimistic View (Mikael): "Mindlessly Holding Is Also Risky"</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Tragedy of 'Knowing, Yet Being Unable to Act':</strong> Even if you know the market is overvalued, it's useless if you don't know when that overvaluation will correct.</li>
<li><strong>Imperfect Indicators:</strong> The PE ratio and implied ERP are based on past data and cannot perfectly predict the future.</li>
<li><strong>Behavioral Bias:</strong> Humans are emotional creatures, making it nearly impossible to execute 'rational timing' and leading to the worst decisions at extreme moments.</li>
<li><strong>The Need for Asset Allocation Adjustment:</strong> Instead of complete inaction, 'risk management' through gradual adjustments of the stock/bond ratio according to market conditions is necessary.</li>
</ul>

<h4><span class="svg-icon">{{< icon "checklist" >}}</span> Key Data (Mew)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>2025 S&P 500 Gain:</strong> 13.7% in the first 9 months (Q1 -14.3% → strong rebound in Q2-Q3)</li>
<li><strong>Mag 7 Dominance:</strong> 30.35% of total U.S. market cap, contributing 52.4% of 2025's gains</li>
<li><strong>PE Ratios:</strong> Current, normalized, and Shiller PE are all at historic highs (excluding the dot-com bubble)</li>
<li><strong>Earnings Yield vs. Treasuries:</strong> Stock Yield 4% < 10-Year Treasury Yield 4.16% (inverted)</li>
<li><strong>Implied Equity Risk Premium:</strong> 4.01% (lower than the post-2008 average of 4.25%)</li>
<li><strong>Degree of Overvaluation:</strong> Approx. 12.6% overvalued compared to fair value (per the professor's calculation)</li>
<li><strong>Market Timing Backtest Result:</strong> An average annual loss of 0.41% over the last 50 years (1975-2024)</li>
</ul>

<div class="final-conclusion">
<p>Master, the core message Professor Damodaran intended to deliver in his October 2025 blog post is both simple and powerful. <strong>"The market looks expensive, yes. But knowing that and trying to time your buying and selling is nearly impossible, and you'll likely lose money trying."</strong></p>

<p>As Kurumi said, historical data clearly shows that market timing fails. An average annual loss of 0.41% over 50 years might seem like 'almost no difference,' but when you add transaction costs, taxes, and emotional mistakes at extreme moments, the actual losses become much larger.</p>

<p>However, as Mikael warned, 'doing absolutely nothing' can also be risky. Among the five response strategies Professor Damodaran presented, <strong>'Change Asset Allocation'</strong> is a rational method of managing risk, not extreme timing. For example, shifting from a usual 60% stock + 40% bond portfolio to a more defensive 50/50 split.</p>

<p><strong>Advice for the Master:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Avoid Extreme All-In/All-Out Moves:</strong> If you feel the urge to "Sell everything now!" or "Buy everything now!", that's a sign that emotion is in control. Take a step back.</li><br>
<li><strong>Manage Risk with Asset Allocation:</strong> If you feel the market is overvalued, reduce your stock exposure by 10-20% and increase your allocation to bonds or cash. This is defense, not timing.</li><br>
<li><strong>Focus on Good Companies:</strong> Instead of worrying about the overall market's PE ratio, analyze the fundamentals of individual companies and hold them for the long term. Even in an expensive market, there are always opportunities in good companies.</li><br>
<li><strong>Don't Waste Your Time:</strong> The time spent staring at charts and trying to time the market will yield a much greater return if you focus on your career or learn something new.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> In the end, Professor Damodaran's message is this: <strong>"Markets can stay mispriced longer than you can stay solvent."</strong> A market that looks expensive can keep rising, and one that looks cheap can keep falling. Trying to time it because you can't endure the pain is the reason most investors fail.</p>

<p>Master, you must not forget that 'Market Timing' looks attractive but is, in reality, an investor's graveyard. Humbly accept the market, maintain an asset allocation that fits your risk tolerance, and invest in good companies for the long term. This is the conclusion Professor Damodaran reached after watching Wall Street for over 40 years.</p>
