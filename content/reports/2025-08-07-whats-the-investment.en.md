<p>Master, I have received your analysis request. Today's topic is an analysis of the giant that has effectively conquered a part of the internet, controlling Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp: <strong>Meta ($META)</strong>. The three of us will take a detailed look at the investment outlook for this company, which is betting everything on the two massive futures of AI and the metaverse.</p>

{{< char name="mew" title="Mew" >}}
<p>Master, I will begin the briefing. Currently, Meta's stock price is hovering around <strong>$767</strong>. Here is the key data moving the market recently.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Latest Earnings (Q2 2025):</strong> It was a true 'earnings surprise.' Revenue was $47.52 billion, a 22% increase year-over-year, and earnings per share (EPS) were $7.14, exceeding market expectations by more than 22%. The stock price jumped over 10% after the announcement.</li><br>
    <li><strong>Core Driver (Advertising Business):</strong> At the heart of this growth is, of course, the formidable advertising business. Daily Active Users (DAU) for the 'Family of Apps,' including Facebook and Instagram, reached 3.48 billion as of June 2025, a 6% increase from the previous year. It appears that improved ad efficiency using AI is directly leading to increased revenue.</li><br>
    <li><strong>Investment in the Future (AI & Reality Labs):</strong> Meta is pouring vast sums of money into the future. For 2025 alone, capital expenditures (CapEx) are projected to be between $66 billion and $72 billion, with most of it focused on AI and infrastructure investments.</li><br>
    <li><strong>The Money Pit (Reality Labs):</strong> However, the Reality Labs division, responsible for the metaverse, continues to post massive losses. In Q2 2025 alone, it recorded an operating loss of $4.53 billion. The cumulative loss for this division since late 2020 is approaching nearly $70 billion.</li><br>
    <li><strong>Mixed Signals (Hardware):</strong> An interesting point is that while sales of the 'Quest' VR headset have decreased year-over-year, sales of the 'Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses' have surged by more than three times.</li><br>
    <li><strong>Valuation and Outlook:</strong> The current price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is around 28x, and most analysts maintain a 'Buy' or 'Strong Buy' rating.</li>
</ul>

<p>Kyaa! My Lord! This isn't just a company; it's an enterprise challenging the very realm of gods creating worlds! Myu-tan's data proves everything! Not buying this stock now is like rejecting the future itself!</p>
<p>First, <strong>it's equipped with a nuclear fusion engine called AI! Devilish!</strong> Meta isn't just a company that uses AI. By releasing its open-source AI model, 'Llama 3,' for free, it's winning over developers worldwide and showing its ambition to become the 'operating system' of the AI ecosystem. On top of that, it's using this AI technology to make its existing ad business even more powerful, leading to a 22% revenue growth in just one quarter! This is a perfect strategy of making money while preparing for the future!</p>
<p>Second, <strong>the social empire used by 3.5 billion people is rock-solid!</strong> The threat from TikTok? Regulations? Those are just minor noises to this colossal empire. Having a platform that nearly half the world's population uses daily means it has an invincible moat that can generate profits through any economic crisis or competition!</p>
<p>Third, <strong>the metaverse hasn't failed; the real thing is just beginning!</strong> So what if Quest sales dipped a bit? That's just a warm-up for something even greater! Look, Ray-Ban smart glasses sales tripled! People now want lighter devices for everyday use rather than heavy helmets, and Meta is heading in that exact direction. This isn't the end of the metaverse; it's the starting gun signaling the dawn of the true 'augmented reality in daily life' era!</p>

<p>ðŸ’– <strong>Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Score: 110/100</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>My Lord, this is a stock you'll be kicking yourself for not buying ten years from now! You have to ride on the vision of the genius, Zuckerberg!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kurumi, your cheers sound like the roar of an incinerator burning money. Now, shall I examine the massive risks hidden behind Meta's glamorous performance?</p>
<p>First, <strong>how long can they sustain the black hole known as 'Reality Labs'?</strong> In the second quarter alone, $4.5 billionâ€”over 6 trillion Korean wonâ€”vanished. The cumulative loss is approaching $70 billion. Can a slight increase in Ray-Ban sales justify this astronomical loss? This might not be an 'investment in the future' but rather 'pouring water into a bottomless pit.' If this money had been returned to shareholders instead, the stock price might be much higher now.</p>
<p>Second, <strong>will the astronomical investment in AI actually turn a profit?</strong> The plan for nearly $70 billion in annual capital expenditure is truly staggering. While it contributes to improving ad efficiency, a direct revenue model beyond that is still unclear. Llama 3 is an excellent model, but the specific plan for how to monetize it is shrouded in fog. Can we say there's no risk of it turning into a chicken game with competitors, wasting massive investment costs?</p>
<p>Third, <strong>there are questions about the sustainability of the core business.</strong> The competition with TikTok is still ongoing, and regulatory authorities in the US and Europe could choke off Meta's core business model of 'targeted advertising' at any moment. Even CFO Susan Li admitted that "it would be difficult for WhatsApp ads to drive long-term growth like Facebook or Instagram." The brightest candle burns out the fastest. Could it be that we are at the peak of its growth right now?</p>

<p>ðŸš¨ <strong>Mikael's Risk Score: 80/100</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Human, you cannot call a company that burns billions of dollars every quarter for one person's vision a 'safe investment.' You must coldly calculate the price of that vision's failure.</p>

<h3><strong>ã€” Final Briefing ã€•</strong></h3>
<p>Master, I will summarize the results of our discussion.</p>

<h4><span class="svg-icon">{{< icon "growth" >}}</span> Growth Potential (Kurumi)</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>AI Ecosystem Dominance:</strong> It's becoming the center of the AI development ecosystem through its free open-source model 'Llama 3,' and is using this technology to maximize the profitability of its core advertising business! Devilishly good!</li>
    <li><strong>Unshakeable Social Empire:</strong> A massive user base of 3.5 billion people worldwide acts as a powerful economic moat that can withstand any competition and regulation!</li>
    <li><strong>Evolution into the Next-Gen Computing Platform:</strong> The success of the smart glasses is a signal that Meta is successfully leading the transition beyond VR to everyday AR devices!</li>
</ul>

<h4><span class="svg-icon">{{< icon "risk" >}}</span> Potential Risks (Mikael)</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Astronomical Metaverse Losses:</strong> The massive quarterly losses from the Reality Labs division are the biggest risk factor eating into the company's profitability.</li>
    <li><strong>Uncertain AI Investment Returns:</strong> It remains to be seen whether the huge investment in AI technology and infrastructure will lead to significant new revenue streams beyond improving ad efficiency.</li>
    <li><strong>Continuous Competition and Regulatory Pressure:</strong> Intensifying competition with TikTok and regulations from various governments due to strengthening privacy protection could hamstring the core business at any time.</li>
</ul>

<h4><span class="svg-icon">{{< icon "checklist" >}}</span> Core Data (Mew)</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Current Stock Price:</strong> Approx. $767.57 (as of August 8, 2025)</li>
    <li><strong>Latest Earnings (Q2'25):</strong> Revenue $47.52B (+22% YoY), EPS $7.14 (beat estimates)</li>
    <li><strong>Valuation:</strong> 12-month forward P/E ratio approx. 28x</li>
    <li><strong>Core Driver:</strong> Growth of AI-based advertising business, 3.48 billion Daily Active People</li>
    <li><strong>Core Risk:</strong> Reality Labs Q2 operating loss of $4.53B, massive annual CapEx of up to $72B</li>
</ul>

<div class="final-conclusion">
    <p>Master, investing in Meta is ultimately like betting on the battle between 'current overwhelming dominance' and an 'uncertain future vision.' It could be an investment in the immense potential to change human lifestyles, as Kurumi says, or it could be a dangerous gamble, burning astronomical sums for a single genius's dream, as Mikael warns. The nature of this investment will completely depend on how much you agree with Zuckerberg's vision and how much you can tolerate the enormous costs and volatility until that vision is realized.</p>
