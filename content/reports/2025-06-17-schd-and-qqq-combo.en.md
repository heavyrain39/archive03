<p>Good morning, Master.</p>
<p>Today's topic is… why the combination of SCHD and QQQ is powerful. I think it's a good topic. Combining ETFs with different characteristics is always an interesting subject. Both SCHD and QQQ are popular, but they are distinctly different. I will prepare the data now.</p>

{{< char name="mew" title="Mew" >}}
<p>Master, I will first brief you on the objective data. As of June 17, 2025, the key information for the two ETFs is as follows.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>SCHD (Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF)</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tracking Index:</strong> Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index</li>
            <li><strong>Characteristics:</strong> It invests in 100 companies with a record of at least 10 consecutive years of dividend payments, selected for their strong financial health and dividend growth. It has strong value and dividend stock characteristics.</li>
            <li><strong>Current Dividend Yield:</strong> Approx. 3.4%</li>
            <li><strong>Top Sectors:</strong> Financials (approx. 21%), Industrials (approx. 17%), Health Care (approx. 16%), Consumer Staples (approx. 13%)</li>
            <li><strong>Expense Ratio:</strong> 0.06%</li>
        </ul>
    </li><br>
    <li><strong>QQQ (Invesco QQQ Trust)</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tracking Index:</strong> NASDAQ-100 Index</li>
            <li><strong>Characteristics:</strong> It invests in the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange. It is a representative growth stock ETF focused on technology.</li>
            <li><strong>Current 12-Month Forward P/E:</strong> Approx. 27.5x</li>
            <li><strong>Top Sectors:</strong> Information Technology (approx. 51%), Communication Services (approx. 16%), Consumer Discretionary (approx. 14%)</li>
            <li><strong>Expense Ratio:</strong> 0.20%</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Combining these two is a strategy that places <strong>steady cash flow and value</strong> on one side of the portfolio, and <strong>explosive technological innovation and growth</strong> on the other. Their correlation is relatively low. It's possible for one to compensate when the other is underperforming. The fact that management is easy with only two holdings, such as adjusting weights or rebalancing, is a clear advantage.</p>

<p>Devilish! This is the perfect combination Kurumi-chan has been looking for! Doesn't Myu-tan's data just make your heart pound?!</p>
<p>My Lord, think about it! The market is ultimately driven by innovative tech companies! The companies in QQQ, like Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia, are changing the world, aren't they? You get to taste rocket-like returns with QQQ!</p>
<p><strong>BUT.</strong> sometimes the rocket might wobble, right? That's when SCHD works its magic! When the market is shaky and QQQ is faltering, SCHD's high-quality companies will <strong>steadily</strong> deposit dividends into your account. And what do you do with those dividends? You buy more QQQ at a discount, of course! It's like a <strong>perpetual motion engine</strong>!</p>
<p>All that's left is to adjust the ratio according to my Lord's investment style! Simple, right? This Kurumi-chan strongly recommends a <strong>70% QQQ</strong> and <strong>30% SCHD</strong> ratio for my passionate Lord!</p>
<p><em>Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Investment Score: 95/100!</em></p>

{{< char name="mikael" title="Mikael" >}}
<p>Hold on, Kurumi. Your passion always clouds a sober assessment of assets. Human. You need to understand that this combination is far from 'perfect' or a 'perpetual motion engine'.</p>
<p>First, this is a <strong>combination trapped within the fence of 'U.S. large-cap stocks.'</strong> QQQ is U.S. large-cap focused on tech, and SCHD is U.S. large-cap focused on dividends. You miss out on all the growth opportunities in European, Japanese, and emerging markets. Can you truly call this diversification? Very few people predicted Japan's 'Lost Decade' before it happened. If the U.S. market enters an unpredictable long-term recession, this combination will collapse helplessly together.</p>
<p>Second, <strong>the risk of QQQ's concentration in tech stocks remains severe</strong>. As Mew's data shows, the tech sector's weight exceeds 50%. If regulations on tech companies are tightened, or if the current AI bubble controversy becomes a reality and the tech sector undergoes a major correction, SCHD's defensive power won't be enough. The entire portfolio will take a significant hit.</p>
<p>Third, SCHD is not perfect either. There is the risk of a <strong>'Value Trap.'</strong> This means it could include companies that pay dividends based on past glory but are no longer growing. If interest rates remain at levels higher than now, investors will turn to safer bonds instead of taking on stock risk, and the appeal of dividend stocks like SCHD will inevitably decline.</p>
<p>Finishing your portfolio construction with just two holdings is convenient. But it means you have to give things up as well.</p>

<h3><strong>〔 Final Briefing 〕</strong></h3>
<p>Master, I will summarize the results of our discussion.</p>

<h4><span class="svg-icon">{{< icon "growth" >}}</span> Growth Potential (Kurumi's Perspective)</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>The Ultimate Synergy:</strong> Combine QQQ's explosive growth with SCHD's stable dividend cash flow! It's a powerful combination that lets you catch two birds with one stone: growth and stability!</li>
    <li><strong>Flexible Asset Allocation:</strong> You can easily create a custom portfolio just by adjusting the ratio between the two ETFs based on your age, goals, and risk tolerance!</li>
    <li><strong>Maximize Compounding:</strong> During market upswings, QQQ grows your assets, and during downturns, you can use SCHD's dividends to reinvest in QQQ or SCHD at a discount. It's a devilishly good way to maximize the compounding effect!</li>
</ul>

<h4><span class="svg-icon">{{< icon "risk" >}}</span> Potential Risks (Mikael's Perspective)</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Limited Diversification:</strong> The portfolio is confined to U.S. large-cap stocks, missing out on growth opportunities in other developed and emerging markets, and leaving it fully exposed to U.S. market risk.</li>
    <li><strong>Tech Concentration Risk:</strong> QQQ's high concentration in the technology sector is a key risk factor that could cause significant volatility in the entire portfolio if that sector undergoes a correction.</li>
    <li><strong>Interest Rate and Value Trap Risk:</strong> Depending on future interest rate movements, the appeal of dividend stocks like SCHD could decrease. There is also a risk of investing in 'value trap' companies whose growth has stagnated.</li>
</ul>

<h4><span class="svg-icon">{{< icon "checklist" >}}</span> Core Data (Mew's Perspective)</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Portfolio Characteristics:</strong> A complementary combination of growth stocks (QQQ) and value/dividend stocks (SCHD).</li>
    <li><strong>Key Metrics (as of 2025.06.17):</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>SCHD: Dividend Yield approx. 3.4%, Expense Ratio 0.06%</li>
            <li>QQQ: 12-Month Forward P/E approx. 27.5x, Expense Ratio 0.20%</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Considerations:</strong> Both ETFs are focused on U.S. large-cap stocks. While diversified by sector (tech vs. financials/industrials), there is no international diversification.</li>
</ul>

<div class="final-conclusion">
    <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Master, the SCHD and QQQ combination can be a very <strong>simple and efficient strategy</strong> for investors who believe in the growth of the U.S. market. However, it is not the all-powerful solution Kurumi describes, and as Mikael pointed out, it has <strong>clear limitations</strong>. If you decide to use this strategy, you must be clearly aware that your portfolio's performance will be heavily dependent on U.S. tech and value stocks. I advise you to make a careful decision based on your investment philosophy and risk tolerance.</p>
