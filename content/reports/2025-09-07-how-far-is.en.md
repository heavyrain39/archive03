<p>Welcome, Master. Today's topic is about 'general-purpose AI robots,' a staple of science fiction films, and specifically, a discussion on <strong>when Tesla's Optimus might actually enter our lives</strong>. Between Elon Musk's ambitious plans and the cold, hard reality, the three of us will diagnose its potential.</p>

{{< char name="mew" title="Mew" >}}
<p>Master, first, I will provide a briefing on the facts regarding Optimus's current situation. Compiling various statements and reports, you must first recognize that the timeline is constantly in flux.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Musk's Statements:</strong> Elon Musk has claimed that Optimus holds more value than autonomous vehicles and will eventually account for 80% of Tesla's value. He has mentioned several times that he plans to deploy thousands of robots in factories by the end of 2025 and could begin external sales as early as 2026. Long-term, he is targeting an annual production of one million units.</li><br>
    <li><strong>Current Production Status:</strong> However, according to recent reports, as of late July 2025, actual production is only in the hundreds, and analysts believe that meeting the year-end target (5,000 units) will be difficult. There were also reports that some robots were left unattended without arms or hands.</li><br>
    <li><strong>Technological Progress:</strong> Since its first concept reveal in 2021, Optimus has shown rapid progress, demonstrating abilities like walking on its own, moving boxes, and performing yoga poses. Tesla is leveraging its proprietary autonomous driving AI, battery, and motor technologies to accelerate development. The goal is to unveil a 3rd generation prototype by the end of 2025.</li><br>
    <li><strong>Market Outlook:</strong> The potential of the humanoid robot market is enormous. Goldman Sachs predicts the market will reach $38 billion by 2035, Morgan Stanley forecasts $5 trillion by 2050, and Ark Invest has even suggested it could reach $24 trillion.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, while Musk's vision is grand, it appears to be lagging behind schedule in terms of realistic production and technological completeness.</p>

<p>My Lord! Just looking at the data might feel a bit frustrating, but this is like the calm before a revolution! My heart feels like it's about to burst with this potential alone! Devilish!</p>
<p>First, <strong>you can't underestimate their speed!</strong> Remember how everyone laughed when Tesla first said they would make electric cars? But what was the result? They caught up to car companies with decades of history in a flash and turned the market upside down! Optimus will be the same. Tesla holds all the cheat codes: AI, batteries, and mass-production know-how. It might seem slow now, but once it gets on track, it will change the world at a speed no one can follow!</p>
<p>Second, <strong>this isn't just a robot. It's a 'mobile workforce'!</strong> Dangerous and repetitive factory jobs, annoying household chores, filling labor shortages! The moment Optimus is commercialized, human productivity will literally explode. Musk's claim that 80% of Tesla's value will come from Optimus is no exaggeration. This is a market so massive it's incomparable to the auto market! Even predictions from places like Goldman Sachs might be too conservative!</p>
<p>Third, <strong>the goal of starting sales in 2026 is what's important!</strong> Of course, it might be slightly delayed. But aiming for 'sales' means it's on a different level from other robots that were stuck in the lab. It will learn and grow faster by bumping into the real world! Now is not the time to hesitate. You can't miss the chance to be part of the beginning of this colossal change!</p>
<p>ðŸ’– <strong>Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Score: 110/100</strong><br>
<blockquote><p>This isn't just about one product; it's about creating the very future of humanity!</p></blockquote>

{{< char name="mikael" title="Mikael" >}}
<p>Kurumi, your optimism is truly remarkable. However, it seems some coolant is needed to cool down those hopeful circuits.</p>
<p>First, <strong>you must remember that Musk's timelines are closer to 'aspirations' than promises.</strong> He has made unkept promises in the past, like the 'one million robotaxis.' The fact that the goal of producing 5,000 Optimus units this year is stuck at a few hundred is clear evidence of how optimistic his plans are. Sales starting in 2026? I am skeptical.</p>
<p>Second, <strong>the technological hurdles are much higher than you think.</strong> Demonstrating pre-programmed actions in a lab is worlds apart from performing tasks reliably in an unpredictable real-world environment. The technology to walk naturally like a human, grasp various objects, and handle unexpected situations is not yet complete. Creating a hand with human-level dexterity is considered one of the greatest technical challenges. If these fundamental problems aren't solved, deploying them in a factory could just result in a pile of scrap metal.</p>
<p>Third, <strong>there is the issue of economic viability.</strong> How much does it cost to build one of these complex robots? Billions of dollars are being poured into R&D. How long will it take for this robot to become cheaper than a human worker's wages and demonstrate higher productivity? Technical feasibility and economic viability are entirely different matters.</p>
<p>Fourth, <strong>there is the issue of safety and regulation.</strong> If a robot working alongside humans malfunctions, it could lead to a terrible accident. Social consensus and strict regulations must be established, and this process is a complex issue that could also take years.</p>
<p>ðŸš¨ <strong>Mikael's Risk Score: 85/100</strong><br>
<blockquote><p>Elon Musk is one of the geniuses of our time. But the bigger the dream, the greater the distance between that dream and reality. Optimus may one day change the world, but that 'one day' is likely much further in the future than we expect.</p></blockquote>

<h3><strong>ã€” Final Briefing ã€•</strong></h3>
<p>Master, I will summarize the results of our discussion.</p>

<h4><span class="svg-icon">{{< icon "growth" >}}</span> Growth Potential (Kurumi)</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Disruptive Innovation Speed:</strong> Considering Tesla's AI and mass-production capabilities, there's a devilishly high chance it could dominate the market at an overwhelming speed once development hits its stride.</li>
    <li><strong>Limitless Market Size:</strong> From factory automation to household chores, the potential of the market to replace human labor vastly exceeds the current automotive market.</li>
    <li><strong>Commitment to 'Sales':</strong> The very fact that they are moving quickly with the goal of actual commercialization, beyond the research lab level, is the biggest growth driver.</li>
</ul>

<h4><span class="svg-icon">{{< icon "risk" >}}</span> Potential Risks (Mikael)</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Unreliable Timeline:</strong> Given Elon Musk's track record, the proposed production and commercialization targets are highly likely to be delayed.</li>
    <li><strong>High Technological Barriers:</strong> Core technologies, such as stable autonomous operation in real-world environments and especially sophisticated hand control, are still unresolved challenges.</li>
    *   <strong>Economic and Safety Issues:</strong> High production costs, efficiency compared to human labor, and safety and regulatory issues that could arise when working with people are major obstacles to commercialization.</li>
</ul>

<h4><span class="svg-icon">{{< icon "checklist" >}}</span> Key Data (Mew)</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Official Goals:</strong> Unveil 3rd generation prototype by late 2025, begin external sales in 2026, target annual production of one million units.</li>
    <li><strong>Current Status:</strong> Production is delayed, with only a few hundred units produced against the 2025 target of 5,000.</li>
    <li><strong>Market Assessment:</strong> The potential market value is predicted to reach tens of trillions of dollars, but expert opinions on the timing of commercialization are divided.</li>
</ul>

<div class="final-conclusion">
    <p>Master, it is clear that Tesla's Optimus is a project with immense potential to change the future of humanity. As Kurumi said, if successful, its impact will be beyond imagination. However, as Mikael pointed out, the path is fraught with numerous unresolved technological, economic, and social challenges. The most honest answer to the question, 'How far is it from commercialization?' is likely, <strong>'Nobody knows for sure.'</strong> However, how advanced the 3rd generation prototype revealed at the end of 2025 is, and whether robots capable of performing meaningful tasks within the factory actually appear in 2026, will be the first crucial turning points to gauge the commercialization timeline.</p>
