<p>Master, I have received today's topic. It's about your friend who is suffering <strong>a significant loss from their Ripple (XRP) investment.</strong></p>
<p>I am sorry to hear about your friend's situation. Experiencing a loss in an investment is a painful thing. The three of us will analyze this problem properly to provide a starting point for you and your friend to think about how to respond going forward.</p>

{{< char name="mikael" title="Mikael" >}}
<p>Your friend's loss is unfortunate, but we must not be swayed by emotion. In situations like this, it's more important than ever to face reality with a cool head. Let's begin.</p>

{{< char name="mew" title="Mew" >}}
<p>I will now brief you with a summary of the currently available data.</p>
{{< tv-chart ticker="XRPUSD" >}}
<ul>
    <li><strong>Price Trend:</strong> Ripple (XRP) hit a peak of around $3.40 on January 15, 2025. As of today (June 27, 2025), it is trading near $2.00, a drop of about 41%. A decline of this magnitude is quite significant, even in the highly volatile cryptocurrency market.</li><br>
    <li><strong>Key Driver (SEC Lawsuit):</strong> The primary cause of the price surge and subsequent crash appears to be news related to the long-standing lawsuit with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In early 2025, expectations that the lawsuit would conclude favorably for Ripple reached a fever pitch, causing the price to skyrocket. However, recent news about a settlement on the penalty amount for some issues or a 'temporary pause' in the appeal process led to a price correction, driven by a mix of 'sell the news' phenomena and disappointment that it wasn't a complete victory. Some experts anticipate the lawsuit could be fully resolved around August of this year, but nothing has been confirmed.</li><br>
    <li><strong>Business Data:</strong> Ripple's business itself is continuing to expand. In particular, its cross-border payment solution, On-Demand Liquidity (ODL), continues to announce new partnerships with financial institutions in Asia and the Middle East. The fact that Ripple is participating in discussions related to CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies) in several countries is also a positive sign.</li><br>
    <li><strong>Technical Data:</strong> The XRP Ledger (XRPL) itself is also continuously being upgraded. Recent technical advancements include a sidechain compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), regulatory compliance features for institutional adoption, and the introduction of a new token standard (MPT). This shows the potential for ecosystem expansion beyond XRP's simple payment function.</li>
</ul>
<p>To summarize, the price has been on an extreme roller coaster due to lawsuit-related news, but Ripple's business and technological foundations are steadily developing. These are the facts so far.</p>

{{< char name="kurumi" title="Kurumi" >}}
<p>Thanks for the data, Myu-tan! My Lord! Look at this! I think this isn't a situation for despair, but a devilishly good opportunity!</p>
<p>Your friend might be heartbroken from buying near the peak, but isn't that proof that XRP's potential had exploded? We saw with our own eyes that it could go to $3.40!</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>The bad news is almost gone!</strong> The biggest shackle holding back XRP for years was the SEC lawsuit. But looking at the search results, it feels like it's almost over! There's hope it will end in August, and they're agreeing on a fine! This should be seen as a healthy correction that happens as uncertainty is resolved. This isn't a major disaster!</li><br>
    <li><strong>The business is really growing!</strong> This isn't just some coin speculation. Ripple is actually making money with ODL and partnering with banks all over the world! It's a project with real 'substance,' the kind Mika-pi likes. And think about it, CBDCs are the future of money, and Ripple's tech might be part of it. My heart is pounding just imagining it!</li><br>
    <li><strong>And now the price is cheap!</strong> It's a 40% discount from the peak! Even old Warren Buffett said that the time to be brave is when everyone else is fearful! Your friend selling now would be like running out of a store right before the sale ends. If they have the funds, this is a time to seriously consider 'buying the dip' to lower their average purchase price!</li>
</ul>
<p>Considering all of this, Kurumi's <strong>'Heart-o-Meter'</strong> score is <strong>85</strong>! You have to bet on the future!</p>

{{< char name="mikael" title="Mikael" >}}
<p>Kurumi. You always forget that your endless optimism can put a human's assets at risk.</p>
<p>Human, please relay this to your friend. Now is not the time to be seduced by Kurumi's sweet words. It is a time to face the painful reality and imagine the worst-case scenario.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>That 'correction' is the risk.</strong> Kurumi describes the drop from $3.40 to $2.00 as a 'sale,' but conversely, it is proof that this is an extremely dangerous asset where over 40% of its value can evaporate in a matter of days. Your friend is living proof of that. Can you withstand this volatility? What will you do if it drops another 40% from here? What about when it hits $1.20? Will you call that a 'clearance sale'?</li><br>
    <li><strong>The lawsuit risk is not over.</strong> 'Almost resolved' and 'completely resolved' are worlds apart. The possibility of an SEC appeal still remains, and the final ruling may not meet the market's expectations. Furthermore, this is just the U.S. case. If other major countries classify XRP as a security, this crisis could repeat itself. The regulatory risk is still very much ongoing.</li><br>
    <li><strong>Competition is fierce.</strong> You speak as if Ripple's ODL is the only solution, but the reality is different. SWIFT, the incumbent giant of traditional finance, is continuously improving its remittance system with services like GPI, and other blockchain projects like Stellar (XLM) and numerous stablecoins are also targeting the cross-border payments market. There is no guarantee that Ripple will win this competition.</li><br>
    <li><strong>The centralization issue persists.</strong> XRP is still not free from the criticism that Ripple Labs holds and controls a large supply. This goes against the spirit of blockchain, which values decentralization, and is a risk factor that could act as potential selling pressure at any time.</li>
</ul>
<p>I would rate the 'Risk Score' of this investment at <strong>75</strong>, where closer to 100 means more dangerous. Considering your friend's situation, a more conservative approach is necessary. The logic of "it's cheaper, so let's buy more" is closer to gambling than investing.</p>

<h3><strong>〔 Final Briefing 〕</strong></h3>
<p>Master, I will summarize our three perspectives. I hope this helps you and your friend make a rational decision.</p>

<h4><span class="svg-icon">{{< icon "growth" >}}</span> Growth Potential (Kurumi's Perspective)</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Resolution of Lawsuit Uncertainty:</strong> As the biggest negative factor, the SEC lawsuit, enters its final stages, the main shackle suppressing XRP's value is likely to be released.</li>
    <li><strong>Tangible Business Growth:</strong> Expanding ODL partnerships with global financial institutions and participation in CBDC discussions are concrete growth drivers with real substance.</li>
    <li><strong>Powerful Future Catalysts:</strong> The potential for a Ripple IPO (Initial Public Offering) and the technical expansion of the XRPL ecosystem (DeFi, NFTs, etc.) hold the potential to drive long-term price appreciation.</li>
</ul>

<h4><span class="svg-icon">{{< icon "risk" >}}</span> Potential Risks (Mikael's Perspective)</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Extreme Price Volatility:</strong> The fact that it can fall by more than 40% in a short period proves how dangerous this asset is. The possibility of further decline should never be ignored.</li>
    <li><strong>Remaining Regulatory Risks:</strong> The SEC lawsuit is not completely over, and new regulatory risks could emerge in other countries.</li>
    <li><strong>Fierce Competition and Centralization Issues:</strong> Survival is not guaranteed in the face of competition from SWIFT and other blockchains, and Ripple's control over the supply is a potential risk factor.</li>
</ul>

<h4><span class="svg-icon">{{< icon "checklist" >}}</span> Core Data (Mew's Perspective)</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Current Price:</strong> Approx. $2.00 (Approx. -41% from the January 2025 peak)</li>
    <li><strong>Key Driver:</strong> Extreme price volatility driven by the intersection of hope and disappointment regarding the SEC lawsuit news.</li>
    <li><strong>Fundamentals:</strong> The business (ODL) is expanding, and the technology (XRPL) is advancing.</li>
    <li><strong>Market Sentiment:</strong> A polarized state where extreme fear and greed coexist.</li>
</ul>

<div class="final-conclusion">
    <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Ripple (XRP) is an asset that holds the clear strength of a 'real-world use case' and the powerful potential catalyst of the SEC lawsuit resolution. However, it also carries extreme price volatility and the undeniable risks of regulation and competition.</p>
    <p>Before making an extreme decision to either sell at a loss or, conversely, to 'buy the dip,' your friend should take this time to calmly reassess the weight of this investment in their total portfolio and the range of loss they can truly tolerate. Please remember that an emotional response is the most dangerous one.</p>
