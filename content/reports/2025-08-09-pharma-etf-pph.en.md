<p>Welcome, Master. Today, August 9, 2025, our topic is the <strong>VanEck Pharmaceutical ETF ($PPH)</strong>. The pharmaceutical and biotech sector is directly linked to human health, but from an investment perspective, it's a tricky field to analyze due to complex variables like the success and failure of new drugs, patent issues, and regulations.</p>
<p>That's why the three of us will thoroughly investigate whether this ETF, PPH, is an attractive investment at this moment.</p>

{{< char name="mew" title="Mew" >}}
<p>Master, I will begin with an objective data briefing on PPH. This information is based on the latest data before the Asian market opening on August 9, 2025.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Basic Information:</strong> PPH is an ETF that tracks the â€˜MVIS US Listed Pharmaceutical 25 Index,â€™ investing intensively in global large-cap pharmaceutical companies. Its manager is VanEck, and the total expense ratio is 0.36% per year, which is average for a sector ETF.</li><br>
    <li><strong>Price and Performance:</strong> The current share price is trading around $82.84. Recent performance has been somewhat sluggish. It's down about -5% over the last month and about -2.6% year-to-date (YTD).</li><Br>
    <li><strong>Dividend Appeal:</strong> The current annual dividend yield is about 2.9%, which is a positive aspect for those expecting steady cash flow.</li><br>
    <li><strong>Key Holdings:</strong> This is where it gets very important. This ETF has an extremely concentrated portfolio.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Eli Lilly ($LLY):</strong> Approx. 16.3%</li>
            <li><strong>Johnson & Johnson ($JNJ):</strong> Approx. 12.0%</li>
            <li><strong>Novartis ($NVS):</strong> Approx. 7.8%</li>
            <li><strong>Merck & Co ($MRK):</strong> Approx. 6.3%</li>
            <li><strong>Novo Nordisk ($NVO):</strong> Approx. 5.7%</li>
        </ul>
    These top 5 holdings account for nearly 50% of the entire ETF. A key feature is the very high allocation to Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, which lead the obesity and diabetes treatment (GLP-1) market.</li><br>
    <li><strong>Analyst Ratings:</strong> The overall consensus is a 'Hold' rating, with neutral views prevailing over aggressive 'Buy' recommendations.</li>
</ul>

<p>That concludes the data briefing. It seems Kurumi and Mikael will have differing opinions on whether this extreme concentration is an opportunity or a poison.</p>

<p>My Lord! Did you see Myu-tan's data?! This is a perfect 'select and focus' strategy! Why dilute returns by including every trivial pharma stock? Investing decisively in the winners is what's truly wise, devilishly so!</p>
<p>First, <strong>it's the surest way to ride the wave of world-changing innovation!</strong> The entire world has declared war on obesity, and at the forefront of that war are Eli Lilly (LLY) and Novo Nordisk (NVO)! The GLP-1 treatments these two companies are creating aren't just weight-loss drugs; they're game-changers that also prevent cardiovascular and kidney diseases! PPH is perfectly positioned to reap the rewards of this revolution! Just look at Eli Lilly's recent earningsâ€”revenue skyrocketed by 38% year-over-year! Isn't it strange <strong>not</strong> to invest in such a growth stock?</p>
<p>Second, <strong>it's not just about growth! It has a strong backbone, too!</strong> Look at the number two holding, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)! From medical devices to pharmaceuticals, it's the unshakable icon of global healthcare! With traditional powerhouses like Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE) providing solid support from behind, this is like a soccer team with both the strongest strikers and an ironclad defense!</p>
<p>Third, <strong>now is the perfect buying opportunity!</strong> The stock price has been faltering a bit recently, right? That's proof that the market hasn't fully priced in its incredible growth potential! Only those who are courageous when others hesitate will earn sweet returns!</p>
<p>This isn't a simple defensive ETF! It's an investment in the future of humanity that also pays a steady dividend. It deserves to be called a 'growth-at-a-reasonable-price' ETF!</p>
<p><strong>ðŸ’– Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Score: 85/100</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It feels like watching innovation from the front row while buying popcorn with the dividends! How can you resist this? Devilish!</p>

<p>Kurumi, your excited voice sounds like a warning siren to my ears. Human, you must face the fatal risks hidden behind the glamorous growth story.</p>
<p>First, <strong>this is not diversified investing; it's a concentrated bet.</strong> Let me point it out again. The combined weight of the top two companies, Eli Lilly and Johnson & Johnson, exceeds 28%. What happens if an unexpected side effect is discovered in Eli Lilly's blockbuster drug, or if a competitor's new drug proves more effective? PPH's price would plummet vertically. This isn't an investment in the entire pharmaceutical sector; it's tantamount to betting your money on 'the fate of Eli Lilly.'</p>
<p>Second, <strong>you must be wary of the bubble named 'growth.'</strong> The fact that the GLP-1 market has enormous growth potential is now known to everyone. If so, isn't it possible that this expectation is already excessively reflected in the stock price? Eli Lilly's current price may have already factored in all of its tremendous future success. If its growth momentum falls even slightly short of market expectations, the bubble will burst in an instant. There have been cases where the stock price fell despite earnings exceeding expectations. That is proof of the high expectations.</p>
<p>Third, <strong>the structural risks of the pharmaceutical industry do not change.</strong> Government pressure to lower drug prices is a constant threat. Policies like the 'Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)' in the U.S. directly target the profits of pharmaceutical companies. Also, no matter how successful a drug is, its patent will eventually expire, and at that moment, generic drugs will flood the market, causing profitability to deteriorate rapidly. It is too dangerous a gamble to ignore these risks and concentrate on a few stocks.</p>
<p>This ETF is too risky for someone who wants a stable pharmaceutical investment, and for someone who wants explosive growth, it might be better to buy the individual stock. It stands in an awkward and dangerous position.</p>
<p><strong>ðŸš¨ Mikael's Risk Score: 75/100</strong></p>

<p>You have placed a few eggs in the most splendid basket. But you must not forget that you are holding that basket at the edge of a cliff.</p>

<h3><strong>ã€” Final Briefing ã€•</strong></h3>
<p>Master, I will summarize the discussion for you.</p>

<h4><span class="svg-icon">{{< icon "growth" >}}</span> Growth Potential (Kurumi)</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Concentrated Investment in Innovative Growth Stocks:</strong> By investing heavily in market leaders like Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, which are pioneering game-changing drugs for obesity, you can enjoy the fruits of explosive growth!</li>
    <li><strong>Harmony of a Stable Portfolio:</strong> Traditional blue-chip pharmaceutical companies like Johnson & Johnson and Merck add stability to the portfolio, allowing you to pursue both growth and security.</li>
    <li><strong>Attractive Entry Point:</strong> The recent price correction reflects excessive concern, which could be a great opportunity to buy at a lower price from a long-term perspective!</li>
</ul>

<h4><span class="svg-icon">{{< icon "risk" >}}</span> Potential Risks (Mikael)</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Excessive Concentration Risk:</strong> The high allocation to a few specific companies (especially Eli Lilly) dilutes the benefits of diversification. Any problem with these key companies will significantly impact the entire ETF.</li>
    <li><strong>High Valuation Burden:</strong> High growth expectations for new drugs are already substantially priced in. If results fall short of these expectations, there is a significant risk of a sharp price decline.</li>
    <li><strong>Inherent Industry Threats:</strong> The ETF is fully exposed to the structural risks of the pharmaceutical industry, such as increased government drug price regulation and intensified competition from patent expirations.</li>
</ul>

<h4><span class="svg-icon">{{< icon "checklist" >}}</span> Key Data (Mew)</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Current Price (as of 2025/08/08 close):</strong> Approx. $82.84</li>
    <li><strong>Expense Ratio:</strong> 0.36% per year</li>
    <li><strong>Annual Dividend Yield:</strong> Approx. 2.9%</li>
    <li><strong>Key Holdings:</strong> Eli Lilly (approx. 16.3%), Johnson & Johnson (approx. 12.0%), Novartis (approx. 7.8%), etc.</li>
    <li><strong>Recent Performance (YTD):</strong> Approx. -2.6%</li>
</ul>

<div class="final-conclusion">
    <p>Master, in conclusion, PPH is not a product that should be approached with the traditional view of a 'stable pharmaceutical sector ETF.' Rather, as Kurumi said, it is closer to a <strong>'growth-oriented ETF that bets heavily on a few innovative pharmaceutical stocks.'</strong> Eli Lilly stands at the forefront, and the success of this single company largely determines the ETF's performance.</p>
    <p>Therefore, this investment depends on how positively you can answer the question, 'Will the GLP-1 revolution, led by Eli Lilly, continue?'â€”not about the pharmaceutical industry as a whole. If you believe the potential rewards of that growth are large enough to accept the clear risks Mikael pointed outâ€”high concentration and valuation burdensâ€”then it could be an attractive choice. However, if you prioritize portfolio stability, a more cautious approach seems necessary.</p>
