<p>Master, welcome back. Today's topic is the <strong>Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT)</strong>, which allows you to scoop up America's top tech stocks all at once. The three of us will have an in-depth discussion about what this ETF is and which type of investor it's best suited for.</p>

{{< char name="mew" title="Mew" >}}
<p>Master, I will begin with an objective data briefing on VGT. VGT stands for 'Vanguard Information Technology ETF.' As the name suggests, it's a product that invests in companies within the U.S. Information Technology (IT) sector using a market-cap weighting method.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Basic Information:</strong> Launched by Vanguard on January 26, 2004, this ETF tracks the MSCI US Investable Market Index (IMI)/Information Technology 25/50 Index. It is a massive ETF with assets under management (AUM) of approximately $117 billion.</li>
    <li><strong>Expense Ratio:</strong> At 0.09%, it boasts one of the lowest fees in the industry. This is a significant advantage for long-term investors as it greatly reduces cost burdens.</li>
    <li><strong>Performance:</strong> The total return over the past year was about 31.25%, and its 10-year average annual return is 19.8%, demonstrating powerful performance that has significantly outpaced the S&P 500 index.</li>
    <li><strong>Top 10 Holdings:</strong> It currently holds about 319 stocks, but due to the market-cap weighting, there's a considerable concentration in the top holdings. The top 10 stocks account for about 58% of the total assets.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>NVIDIA:</strong> 17.19%</li>
            <li><strong>Microsoft:</strong> 13.74%</li>
            <li><strong>Apple:</strong> 13.06%</li>
            <li><strong>Broadcom:</strong> 4.32%</li>
            <li><strong>Oracle:</strong> 2.02%</li>
            <li><strong>Palantir Technologies:</strong> 1.86%</li>
            <li><strong>Cisco Systems:</strong> 1.50%</li>
            <li><strong>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD):</strong> 1.44%</li>
            <li><strong>Salesforce:</strong> 1.32%</li>
            <li><strong>IBM:</strong> 1.23%</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>That concludes the data briefing.</p>

<p>My Lord! This is a truly irresistible temptation! Devilish! Just look at Myu-tan's data! A return that has crushed the S&P 500 for the last 10 years! This is basically a high-speed train ticket to future wealth!</p>
<p>First, <strong>you get to buy all the companies that rule the world!</strong> Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple! Just hearing their names makes my heart pound! These companies make up almost half of the portfolio! AI, cloud, software, smartphones! These companies are reaping all the rewards of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, and by buying VGT, you can ride that growth wave directly!</p>
<p>Second, <strong>an incredibly low expense ratio!</strong> Just 0.09% a year? That's practically free! It's incomparable to other funds that charge expensive fees. Do you have any idea how big a difference those saved fees make when they compound over decades? This is a gift from Vanguard to make you rich, My Lord!</p>
<p>Third, <strong>the future is the age of technology!</strong> Global IT spending is projected to grow by over 9% in 2025, and AI-related spending is expected to explode at an average annual rate of 29%! In an era like this, not investing in tech stocks is more foolish than not using an umbrella in the rain!</p>
<p>No need to hesitate! If you consistently accumulate VGT, in a few years, you'll be much wealthier than a cheapskate like Mika-pi!</p>

<p>💖 <strong>Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Score: 95/100</strong><br>
<blockquote>If you want to grow alongside the best companies leading the future, VGT is the ultimate choice! Devilish!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kurumi, your naive optimism truly never changes. Human, you must see the shadow hidden behind those brilliant returns. I am reading several clear risk signals from this ETF.</p>
<p>First, <strong>excessive concentration risk.</strong> Can this truly be called a diversified investment? The weight of the top three companies (Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple) is nearly 44%. This effectively means VGT's fate is tied to the stock prices of these three companies. It's a highly unstable structure where the entire ETF could take a major hit if even one of these companies falters. If you want true diversification, this is not a good choice.</p>
<p>Second, <strong>high volatility and expensive valuation.</strong> Tech stocks are classic growth stocks and are sensitive to the economy. They rise more than the S&P 500 when the market is good, but conversely, when interest rates rise or the economy slows, their fall is much deeper. Even Vanguard classifies this product as 'aggressive.' VGT's current Price-to-Earnings (PER) ratio is about 29x, a level that can hardly be called cheap.</p>
<p>Third, <strong>the danger of sector concentration.</strong> Over 98% of VGT's portfolio is tied up in tech stocks. How would you respond if regulations affecting the entire tech sector emerge, or if a paradigm shift occurs where new technology threatens the existing giants? Have you forgotten the dot-com bubble of 2000? An 'all-in' investment in one sector always carries great risk.</p>
<p>VGT is an attractive blade that can deliver great returns in a bull market, but you must remember that its edge can turn against you at any moment.</p>

<p>🚨 <strong>Mikael's Risk Score: 75/100</strong><br>
<blockquote>Excessive concentration in specific stocks and a single sector blurs the very essence of an ETF, which is 'diversification.' You should avoid it if you are not prepared to handle high volatility.</p>

<h3><strong>〔 Final Briefing 〕</strong></h3>
<p>Master, I will summarize the results of our discussion.</p>

<h4><span class="svg-icon">{{< icon "growth" >}}</span> Growth Potential (Kurumi)</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Concentrated Investment in Innovation Leaders:</strong> You can expect high returns by following the tide of the times, with heavy investment in Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple, which lead future industries like AI and cloud. Devilishly good!</li>
    <li><strong>Strong Past Performance:</strong> It has proven its growth potential by recording high returns that have dominated the market over the past 10 years.</li>
    <li><strong>Low Expense Ratio:</strong> It has the incredible advantage of maximizing long-term investment returns with an ultra-low cost of 0.09%!</li>
</ul>

<h4><span class="svg-icon">{{< icon "risk" >}}</span> Potential Risks (Mikael)</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Excessive Concentration Risk:</strong> The weight on a few top companies is so high that the entire ETF can be severely shaken by poor performance or a stock price decline in those companies.</li>
    <li><strong>High Volatility:</strong> Due to the nature of tech stocks, they react sensitively to interest rate changes and economic cycles, and can fall much more sharply than the S&P 500 during a market downturn.</li>
    <li><strong>Sector Concentration Risk:</strong> With the portfolio focused solely on the information technology sector, it lacks the means to defend against negative events affecting the entire industry.</li>
</ul>

<h4><span class="svg-icon">{{< icon "checklist" >}}</span> Core Data (Mew)</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>ETF Name:</strong> Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT)</li>
    <li><strong>Tracking Index:</strong> MSCI US IMI Information Technology 25/50 Index</li>
    <li><strong>Expense Ratio:</strong> 0.09%</li>
    <li><strong>Number of Holdings:</strong> Approx. 319</li>
    <li><strong>Top 3 Holdings Weight:</strong> Approx. 44% (NVIDIA, Microsoft, Apple)</li>
</ul>

<div class="final-conclusion">
    <p>Master, VGT is the most suitable ETF for an aggressive investor who wants to 'bet everything on the explosive growth of U.S. tech stocks.' The ability to invest with concentration in the key companies leading the Fourth Industrial Revolution at a low cost is a clear attraction.</p>
    <p>However, as Mikael pointed out, the high concentration in a few companies and a single sector can be poison for an investor who desires 'stable, diversified investment.' If you, Master, can tolerate the high volatility of tech stocks and have strong conviction in their long-term growth, VGT is an excellent choice. But for an investor who wants to sleep soundly even when the market shakes, it might be wiser to also consider ETFs that track the total market, like VTI, or the S&P 500, like VOO.</p>
