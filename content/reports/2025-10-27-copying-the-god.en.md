<p>Master, welcome back. Today, we're going to cover a unique investment product: the <strong>$NANC ETF, which copies the stock trades of the 'God of Investing,' Nancy Pelosi</strong>. The three of us will conduct an in-depth analysis to determine if this ingenious ETF, which replicates the stock trades of Democratic members of the U.S. Congress in real-time, is truly worth investing in.</p>

{{< char name="mew" title="Mew" >}}
<p>Master, I'll begin with an objective data briefing on the NANC ETF. Its official name is the 'Unusual Whales Subversive Democratic Trading ETF,' and its ticker symbol, 'NANC,' is derived from the name of the former Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi.</p>

<p><strong>Basic Information:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Launch Date:</strong> February 7, 2023, making it a relatively new ETF at just two and a half years old.</li>
<li><strong>Issuer:</strong> A joint venture between Subversive Capital Advisors and the fintech company Unusual Whales.</li>
<li><strong>Strategy:</strong> It's an actively managed ETF that tracks and replicates the stock trades disclosed by Democratic members of the U.S. Congress and their spouses under the STOCK Act.</li>
<li><strong>Assets Under Management (AUM):</strong> Approximately $255 million, which is quite large for a niche thematic ETF.</li>
<li><strong>Expense Ratio:</strong> 0.75%, which is much higher than typical index ETFs (0.03-0.10%) but is mid-range for an active ETF.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Performance:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recent 1-Year Return:</strong> Approximately 20.14%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's ~14.57%.</li>
<li><strong>2024 Return:</strong> 26.83%, overwhelmingly beating the category average of 21.45%.</li>
<li><strong>Annualized Return Since Inception:</strong> It has recorded a phenomenal performance of approximately 25.34%.</li>
<li><strong>2025 Year-to-Date:</strong> Up approximately 16.23% as of October 20.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Top Holdings (as of October 2025):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>NVIDIA:</strong> 10.44%</li>
<li><strong>Microsoft:</strong> 7.88%</li>
<li><strong>Alphabet (Google):</strong> 4.88%</li>
<li><strong>Amazon:</strong> 4.84%</li>
<li><strong>Apple:</strong> 3.98%</li>
<li><strong>Salesforce:</strong> 3.00%</li>
<li><strong>Netflix:</strong> 2.83%</li>
</ul>

<p>The number of holdings is around 150-200, but the top 10 holdings account for about 47% of the total assets, indicating a high concentration. In terms of sector allocation, Technology is dominant at 40.43%, followed by Communication Services at 13.04% and Healthcare at 10.67%.</p>

<p><strong>Nancy Pelosi's Investment Performance:</strong></p>
<p>The performance of Nancy Pelosi's portfolio, from which the NANC ETF takes its name, is truly phenomenal. In 2024 alone, she achieved a 70.9% return, while the S&P 500 gained only about 25% in the same period. In 2023, she also posted a 65.5% return. One analysis suggests that if you had followed Pelosi's trades from May 2014, you would have seen a return of over 700% by 2025. The S&P 500 rose only about 230% during the same period.</p>

<p>Pelosi employs a sophisticated investment strategy, primarily using Deep-In-The-Money (DITM) call options. In January 2025, she purchased Tempus AI call options (strike price $20). After the disclosure of Pelosi's purchase, the stock soared 150% in 30 days and is currently up over 200% from the time of purchase. Her NVIDIA call options, purchased in November 2023, generated about $6.6 million in unrealized gains by October 2024.</p>

<p><strong>Key Issue:</strong></p>
<p>NANC's biggest weakness is the 'time lag issue.' According to the STOCK Act, members of Congress must disclose their trades within 30 to 45 days. NANC follows by trading after these disclosures are made. This means the ETF buys the same stock more than a month after the congressperson has already bought it. By then, there's a high probability the stock price has already risen significantly.</p>

<p>My Lord! This is a really fun one! Devilish! Just as Myu-tan said, there's a time lag issue, but the key point is that it's still delivering returns that crush the S&P 500! <strong>Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Score: 82/100!</strong></p>

<p>First, <strong>it has a proven track record!</strong> Nancy Pelosi made a 70.9% return in 2024 alone and has outperformed the S&P 500 by 559% since 2014! That's a higher return than Warren Buffett! Do you think that was just luck? Absolutely not! She entered Big Tech companies like NVIDIA, Microsoft, and Apple with perfect timing.</p>

<p>Second, <strong>it benefits from information asymmetry!</strong> Members of Congress are directly involved in policymaking and are in a position to know in advance where regulatory changes or government subsidies will flow. It's no coincidence that Pelosi bought a large amount of NVIDIA stock before voting on the CHIPS Act! This 'information advantage' is something regular investors can indirectly enjoy through NANC!</p>

<p>Third, <strong>the Tempus AI case proves the 'Pelosi Effect'!</strong> As soon as the disclosure was made that Pelosi bought Tempus AI call options in January 2025, the stock skyrocketed 150% in 30 days! It's now up over 200% from the purchase point! This isn't just because it's a good company; the signal that 'Pelosi bought it' moved the market itself. NANC investors can also leverage this 'brand power'!</p>

<p>Fourth, <strong>the time lag issue? It can actually be an advantage!</strong> So what if you buy 30-45 days late? NANC has still beaten the S&P 500 with an annualized return of over 25% since its inception! That's because the stocks Pelosi picks aren't short-term momentum stocks but long-term growth Big Tech companies. For companies like Microsoft, Apple, and NVIDIA, buying a month late can still yield sufficient returns if held for 2-3 years.</p>

<p>Fifth, <strong>it's crushing the Republican version (GOP, formerly KRUZ)!</strong> There's a GOP ETF that tracks the trades of Republican members in the same way, but its 1-year return is only 18.14%. In contrast, NANC is over 20%! This is proof that the investment acumen of Democratic members, especially Pelosi, is far superior to that of the Republicans!</p>

<p>Sixth, <strong>it's focused on the core companies of the AI era!</strong> If you look at NANC's portfolio, it's filled with companies at the forefront of the AI revolution, like NVIDIA, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon. 2025 is a time when AI spending is projected to grow explosively at an average annual rate of 29%. NANC is right at the center of that growth!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>My Lord, this is practically the only way to legally leverage 'politician's insider information'! It's ethically controversial, but the profits are undeniable! Devilish!</strong></p>

<p>Kurumi, you always get excited by looking only at the surface. Human, in my view, NANC is an 'interesting experiment,' not a serious long-term investment vehicle. My risk score is <strong>72</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>First, it's essentially just a 'Big Tech concentration ETF.'</strong></p>
<p>Look at NANC's top holdings: NVIDIA, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple... Doesn't that look familiar? It's almost identical to the top holdings of the Nasdaq 100 or QQQ ETF. In fact, one analyst pointed out, "NANC's portfolio is so similar to the S&P 500 or tech ETFs that there's no reason to pay the high 0.75% fee." The S&P 500 ETF has a fee of 0.03%, and tech ETFs are around 0.10%. You'd be paying 7 to 25 times more for NANC. It's far more rational to save that money and buy VOO or QQQ instead.</p>

<p><strong>Second, the time lag issue is fatal.</strong></p>
<p>Kurumi said it 'wins despite the time lag,' but that's only because Big Tech has been on a continuous rise for the past two years. What happens if the market enters a period of volatility? Pelosi might buy at the bottom, but NANC would follow 30-45 days later at a high point that's already up 20-30%. What if a correction follows? Only NANC investors would suffer losses. Bitfinex analysts have also warned that "the 30-45 day disclosure delay makes it very difficult to capture true alpha (excess returns)."</p>

<p><strong>Third, the 'Pelosi Effect' is a double-edged sword.</strong></p>
<p>It's true that Tempus AI surged after Pelosi's disclosure, but this is actually a danger sign. If the market drives up a stock price simply because 'Pelosi bought it,' it could be a speculative bubble unrelated to fundamentals. Bubbles eventually burst. Can Tempus AI's market cap of over $10 billion be justified? Furthermore, not all of Pelosi's picks are successful. Some reports suggest that a majority of the stocks she bought in 2025 were actually at a loss.</p>

<p><strong>Fourth, the ethical and regulatory risks are enormous.</strong></p>
<p>In early 2025, Senator Josh Hawley reintroduced the 'PELOSI Act.' This is a bill to completely ban individual stock trading by members of Congress and their families. What happens if it passes? The very reason for NANC's existence disappears. Also, discrepancies have been found in the disclosures of her husband Paul Pelosi's trades. In February 2024, he disclosed buying 70 Palo Alto Networks call options, but when he reported selling them in December, he reported selling 140. This lack of transparency could make them a target for regulators.</p>

<p><strong>Fifth, the concentration risk is too high.</strong></p>
<p>The top 10 holdings make up 47% of the total. This is not true diversification. If NVIDIA or Microsoft were to plummet, NANC would collapse with them. Moreover, the technology sector weight is over 40%. Remember the tech stock crash of 2022? The Nasdaq fell by more than 30%. NANC could suffer the same fate.</p>

<p><strong>Sixth, past performance does not guarantee future results.</strong></p>
<p>Pelosi made a 700% return from 2014-2024? That was during the longest tech bull market in U.S. history. It was a 'Goldilocks' era where all positive factors—QE, zero interest rates, pandemic stimulus, the AI boom—converged. Now, interest rates are high, the economy is uncertain, and tech valuations are at historic highs. Expecting the same returns as in the past is a dangerous delusion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Human, NANC is a marketing product based on 'Pelosi worship.' If you want real alpha, it's far wiser to analyze stocks yourself and diversify with low-cost index funds.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

{{< char name="kurumi" title="Kurumi" >}}
<p>Mika-pi! If you only look at it so negatively, you'll miss the opportunity!</p>

<p>What Mika-pi calls 'just a Big Tech ETF' is actually an advantage! That's because Pelosi is picking the 'strongest of the strong' from Big Tech! QQQ is diversified across 100 stocks, but NANC focuses only on the real winners! And the PELOSI Act? What are the chances of that passing? Bills to ban congressional stock trading have been introduced dozens of times over the last decade but have never passed! Why? Because the members of Congress themselves oppose it!</p>

{{< char name="mikael" title="Mikael" >}}
<p>Kurumi, can you guarantee the law won't pass? The political environment in 2025 is constantly changing. Public opinion on insider trading is worsening, and things could change at any moment. And a 16.23% return year-to-date in 2025? The S&P 500 is also up 13.10%. Can a mere 3% difference justify the high cost of 0.75%?</p>

{{< char name="mew" title="Mew" >}}
<p>After hearing both Kurumi's and Mikael's arguments, the main point becomes clear. The core question is, <strong>'Can NANC consistently generate enough excess return (alpha) to justify its high fees?'</strong></p>

<p>In my view, both have valid points. As Kurumi pointed out, NANC is more than just a 'Big Tech clone'; it creates differentiation through 'timing and selection.' Pelosi bought NVIDIA in November 2023 at $450 and spotted Tempus AI right after its IPO. QQQ holds already successful companies by market cap, but Pelosi preemptively identifies 'companies poised to explode.' This 'timing and selection' is the key to its excess returns.</p>

<p>However, Mikael's concerns cannot be ignored. The 30-45 day time lag can be fatal in a volatile market, and the 0.75% expense ratio will eat into long-term returns. Most importantly, Pelosi's '700% return' was a product of the 2014-2024 tech supercycle, and there's no guarantee that the same environment will continue.</p>

<p>In conclusion, NANC is neither 'complete garbage to be avoided' nor a 'divine move to be bought unconditionally.' It's an 'interesting experiment' and a product worth trying as a satellite strategy for a small allocation. However, the uncertainty and costs are too high to include it in a core portfolio.</p>

<h3><strong>〔 Final Briefing 〕</strong></h3>
<p>Master, I will now summarize our three conclusions on the $NANC ETF.</p>

<h4><span class="svg-icon">{{< icon "growth" >}}</span> Investment Appeal (Kurumi)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Proven Outperformance:</strong> It has a strong track record, with an annualized return of 25.34% since inception and 20.14% in the last year, outperforming the S&P 500 (14.57%) by more than 5-6%. Devilish!</li>
<li><strong>Pelosi's Astonishing Investment Record:</strong> A 70.9% return in 2024 alone, beating the S&P 500 by a 200% margin. A cumulative return of over 700% from 2014-2025 shows performance surpassing even Warren Buffett.</li>
<li><strong>Market Impact of the 'Pelosi Effect':</strong> Tempus AI surged 150% in 30 days and is now up over 200% following Pelosi's purchase disclosure. The disclosure itself has proven 'brand power' to trigger a rally in the stock.</li>
<li><strong>Concentration in Key AI Era Companies:</strong> It strategically concentrates investments in the biggest beneficiaries of the AI revolution, such as NVIDIA (10.44%), Microsoft (7.88%), and Alphabet (4.88%).</li>
<li><strong>Outperforming the Republican Version (GOP):</strong> NANC's 1-year return of 20.14% consistently outperforms the GOP ETF's 18.14%.</li>
</ul>

<h4><span class="svg-icon">{{< icon "risk" >}}</span> Key Risks (Mikael)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fatal Flaw of the 30-45 Day Disclosure Lag:</strong> The time gap between when congress members buy and when NANC actually buys creates a structural limitation, causing the ETF to enter positions late after the price has already risen significantly.</li>
<li><strong>High Expense Ratio:</strong> At 0.75%, it is 25 times more expensive than an S&P 500 ETF (0.03%) and 7.5 times more than a tech ETF (0.10%), a factor that erodes long-term returns.</li>
<li><strong>Excessive Big Tech Concentration:</strong> With the top 10 holdings at 47% and tech sector weight over 40%, the portfolio is effectively similar to QQQ. It lacks true differentiation or diversification benefits.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory Risk:</strong> If legislation like the PELOSI Act, which bans stock trading by members of Congress, is passed, the ETF's reason for existence could disappear.</li>
<li><strong>Disclosure Discrepancy Issues:</strong> Errors such as quantity mismatches in Pelosi's trade disclosures raise questions about reliability and transparency.</li>
<li><strong>Questionable Sustainability of Past Performance:</strong> The 2014-2024 period was a historic tech bull market, but the current high-interest-rate, high-valuation environment makes it difficult to replicate such returns.</li>
</ul>

<h4><span class="svg-icon">{{< icon "checklist" >}}</span> Key Data (Mew)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>ETF Name:</strong> Unusual Whales Subversive Democratic Trading ETF (NANC)</li>
<li><strong>Launch Date:</strong> February 7, 2023</li>
<li><strong>AUM:</strong> Approx. $255 million</li>
<li><strong>Expense Ratio:</strong> 0.75% (annual)</li>
<li><strong>Recent 1-Year Return:</strong> 20.14% (S&P 500: 14.57%)</li>
<li><strong>2024 Return:</strong> 26.83%</li>
<li><strong>Annualized Since Inception:</strong> 25.34%</li>
<li><strong>2025 YTD:</strong> 16.23% (as of Oct 20)</li>
<li><strong>Number of Holdings:</strong> 150-200</li>
<li><strong>Top 10 Holdings Weight:</strong> Approx. 47%</li>
<li><strong>Key Sectors:</strong> Technology 40.43%, Communications 13.04%, Healthcare 10.67%</li>
</ul>

<div class="final-conclusion">
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Master, the NANC ETF is an interesting product with a unique concept of 'copying politicians' trades' that has actually generated excess returns. Kurumi's score of 82 vs. Mikael's risk score of 72, Mew's overall recommendation is <strong>68/100</strong>.</p>

<p>The reason NANC actually creates alpha is because it has value beyond simple Big Tech replication. Pelosi demonstrates differentiation in 'timing and selection,' such as capturing NVIDIA in November 2023 and Tempus AI right after its IPO. The reason it wins despite the 30-45 day lag is that the stocks Pelosi chooses are long-term growth stocks, not short-term speculative ones.</p>

<p>However, it should not be overestimated. Pelosi's '700% return' was a product of the 2014-2024 tech supercycle, and the 0.75% expense ratio is a factor that erodes long-term returns. Year-to-date in 2025, NANC is at 16.23% vs. the S&P 500 at 13.10%, a gap of only 3.13%p. Factoring in the fee difference, the real excess return is even smaller.</p>

<p>Master, if you want 'stable, long-term returns at the lowest possible cost,' a combination of VOO + QQQ is far more rational than NANC. On the other hand, if you're attracted to the 'fun of following Pelosi's trades' and the 'potential for small excess returns,' allocating a small amount isn't a bad choice. I hope you'll listen to both Kurumi's passion and Mikael's caution and make a decision that aligns with your own investment philosophy.</p>
