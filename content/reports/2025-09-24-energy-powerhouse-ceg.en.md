<p>Welcome, Master. Today, on September 24, 2025, our topic is the investment outlook for <strong>Constellation Energy ($CEG)</strong>, the largest nuclear energy company in the United States. Its stock price has surged as it gains attention as a key player to handle the explosive electricity demand of the AI era. I will analyze whether this rally can continue or if there are risks hidden within the heat.</p>

{{< char name="mew" title="Mew" >}}
<p>Master, I will begin with an objective data briefing on Constellation Energy. As of September 2025, this company is emerging as a core component of the U.S. energy market.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Company Status:</strong> Constellation Energy is the largest producer of carbon-free energy in the United States. Notably, it is the dominant No. 1 operator in nuclear energy, responsible for about 20% of the entire U.S. nuclear power generation.</li><br>
<li><strong>Stock Price and Valuation:</strong> The current stock price is trading at around $340 - $350. Its 12-month forward price-to-earnings (Forward P/E) ratio is about 34x, indicating it's receiving a significant premium, far exceeding the utility sector average of 20x.</li><br>
<li><strong>Recent Earnings:</strong> The second-quarter 2025 earnings were very solid. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) were recorded at $1.91, an increase from $1.68 in the same period last year, and the company showed confidence by maintaining its full-year 2025 guidance at $8.90-$9.60.</li><br>
<li><strong>Key Growth Drivers:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI & Data Center Demand:</strong> The explosive growth in electricity demand from data centers is the biggest growth driver. Constellation is rapidly emerging as a stable, carbon-free power source for Big Tech companies, recently signing a <strong>20-year long-term power supply agreement with Meta</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Government Policy (IRA):</strong> The nuclear production tax credit (PTC) included in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) acts as a powerful safety net, protecting the company's profitability when electricity prices fall.</li>
</ul>
</li><br>
<li><strong>Operational Efficiency:</strong> The nuclear power plant operating rate reached 94.8% in the second quarter, proving that its operations are very stable and efficient.</li>
</ul>
<p>To summarize the data, Constellation Energy is valued as one of the biggest beneficiaries of the megatrend of 'power shortages in the AI era' and the policy trend of 'clean energy transition.' However, it is also clear that this expectation is already reflected in the stock price, resulting in a very high valuation.</p>

<p>My Lord! Did you see that data? This isn't just a good stock! It's like the conductor of an express train to the future! Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Score: 95/100!</p>
<p>First, <strong>the food that AI eats is electricity!</strong> Chatbots and image-generating AIs need enormous data centers to get smarter, and those data centers are like hippos that devour electricity 24/7 without rest! There are even forecasts that data center power demand will double within five years. Solar and wind power generate electricity intermittently depending on the weather, but nuclear power always produces a huge amount of electricity steadily, and without carbon emissions! It's only natural that Big Tech companies are lining up to buy Constellation's power! That 20-year contract with Meta is just the beginning!</p>
<p>Second, <strong>the U.S. government has its back!</strong> With the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), they've provided solid insurance, saying, "Hey nuclear power plants, don't worry if you don't make money! We'll subsidize you with taxes!" This is like a magic spell that reduces risk and maximizes profit. A business backed by the country will never fail!</p>
<p>Third, <strong>this isn't just a utility stock!</strong> Mika-pi might always say it's 'expensive,' but the market already sees Constellation not as a simple electric company, but as a key infrastructure tech stock that enables the AI revolution. That's why it's valued so much higher than other utility companies! World-changing companies are supposed to be expensive! In a few years, you'll look back and think even today's price was a devilishly good bargain!</p>

<p>Kurumi, your words are as fiery as ever, but you must realize that such heat can blind an investor. Human, I must point out the cold reality behind this glamorous growth story.</p>
<p>First, the most obvious risk is the <strong>excessively high valuation</strong>. The forward P/E ratio is 34x. This means that all positive future scenarios, such as the explosive growth in AI data center demand, are already fully priced in. If growth falls even slightly short of expectations, the tall tower you've built could collapse from a minor shock. Many analysts are also issuing 'Hold' ratings, warning that the barrier to entry is high for new investors.</p>
<p>Second, you must not forget the <strong>inherent risks of the nuclear industry</strong>. An accident at a nuclear power plant can lead to an irreversible disaster. It also requires enormous capital for operation and maintenance. Constellation plans to invest about $3.0 to $3.5 billion in capital expenditures over 2025 and 2026, which could place a significant burden on the company's cash flow.</p>
<p>Third is <strong>regulatory and policy uncertainty</strong>. The government supports nuclear power now, but policy directions can change at any time if the political landscape shifts. The moment the stance changes from 'pro-nuclear' to 'anti-nuclear,' the company's foundation could be shaken.</p>
<p>I would rate the risk score of this investment at <strong>75</strong>. The growth potential is clear, but in return, you may have to perform a precarious tightrope walk with almost no 'margin of safety'.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Human, the most dangerous moment can be when everyone is cheering. You should not pay a high price to enter a party that is already over.</strong></p>

<h3><strong>〔 Final Briefing 〕</strong></h3>
<p>Master, I will summarize the results of our discussion.</p>
<h4><span class="svg-icon">{{< icon "growth" >}}</span> Growth Potential (Kurumi)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI & Data Center Boom:</strong> Nuclear power is the optimal solution for AI data centers that require stable, carbon-free electricity 24/7, and this is a powerful growth driver that will continue for decades to come.</li>
<li><strong>Policy Support:</strong> The Production Tax Credit (PTC) from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) supports the downside of earnings, increasing investment stability.</li>
<li><strong>Re-evaluation of Market Position:</strong> It is being re-evaluated not as a simple utility company but as a key tech stock supporting AI infrastructure, justifying its premium valuation.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span class="svg-icon">{{< icon "risk" >}}</span> Potential Risks (Mikael)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>High Valuation Burden:</strong> The current stock price has already priced in a significant portion of future growth, so the risk of a price correction increases if earnings fall short of expectations.</li>
<li><strong>Inherent Operational Risks:</strong> Safety issues and massive capital expenditures associated with operating nuclear power plants are ever-present burdens.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory Uncertainty:</strong> Changes in energy policy due to shifts in government, etc., can be an unpredictable variable for the company's long-term business environment.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span class="svg-icon">{{< icon "checklist" >}}</span> Key Data (Mew)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Current Price/PER:</strong> Approx. $345 / Forward P/E approx. 34x</li>
<li><strong>Institutional Investor Consensus:</strong> While many analysts maintain a 'Buy' rating, a significant number also have 'Hold' ratings due to the high valuation.</li>
<li><strong>Key Drivers:</strong> Increased electricity demand from AI and government support for clean energy policies.</li>
</ul>
<div class="final-conclusion">
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Constellation Energy is clearly the 'energy leader' that can most reliably ride the historical wave of the AI revolution. As Kurumi says, the explosive demand may just be in its initial stages. However, as Mikael points out, that expectation is already largely reflected in the stock price, leaving little margin of safety. This investment seems suitable for a Master who has strong conviction in the continued growth of the AI era and can tolerate the volatility that comes with a high valuation.</p>
