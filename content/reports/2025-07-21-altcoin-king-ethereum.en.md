<p>Welcome, Master. Today's topic is the 2025 latter-half outlook for the crypto market's second-in-command, the <strong>'Altcoin King' Ethereum ($ETH)</strong>. With the U.S. spot ETF trading having kicked off in early July, market interest is incredibly high. The three of us will now thoroughly break down Ethereum's future.</p>

{{< char name="mew" title="Mew" >}}
<p>Master, I will first brief you on the key data regarding Ethereum's current situation. As of July 21, 2025, the price of Ethereum is trading around the $3,400 mark. The biggest variables moving the market recently can be summarized as follows.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Spot ETF Launch and Capital Inflow:</strong> Following the final approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in July 2024, spot Ethereum ETFs from various asset managers began trading in earnest in early July. As of July, the net inflow of funds into these ETFs has reached approximately $2.27 billion, with total ETF holdings approaching 5 million ETH. Asset managers like Bitwise have projected up to $10 billion in additional fund inflows in the second half of 2025 alone.</li><br>
    <li><strong>Pectra Upgrade Completion:</strong> On May 7, 2025, Ethereum successfully completed the 'Pectra' upgrade. The core of this upgrade was to ease the 32 ETH unit limit required for staking, allowing up to 2,048 ETH to be deposited at once to receive rewards. This has made it easier for institutions managing large-scale funds to participate in staking. It also included improvements to wallet functionality and increased transaction efficiency.</li><br>
    <li><strong>Supply Change (Deflationary Asset):</strong> Through the EIP-1559 mechanism, Ethereum continues to burn a portion of its transaction fees. Coupled with the increasing amount of staked ETH, the volume of Ethereum circulating in the market is under continuous 'deflationary' pressure.</li><br>
    <li><strong>Competitive Landscape:</strong> Competition with other Layer 1 blockchains, notably Solana, remains fierce. In 2025, Solana's monthly transaction volume growth rate of 25.4% outpaced Ethereum's 9.7%. However, in terms of weekly DApp revenue, Ethereum's $35+ million far exceeds Solana's $6 million, demonstrating that its ecosystem's value-generating capability remains dominant.</li>
</ul>

<p>That concludes the data briefing.</p>

<p>Kyaa! My Lord! This is a truly tremendous opportunity! Myu-tan's data says it all! <strong>Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Score has shot past 120 out of 100!</strong></p>
<p>First, <strong>a tsunami named 'Institutions' is rushing in! Devilish!</strong> We saw it with the Bitcoin ETF, didn't we? At first, it was like, 'Huh? That's it?' and then suddenly, money started getting sucked in like crazy. Ethereum is just getting started! If pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and asset managers allocate just 1% of their portfolios to Ethereum, the amount will be beyond imagination! The ETF has essentially paved a legal highway for that massive capital to flow in!</p>
<p>Second, Ethereum is different from Bitcoin! If Bitcoin is 'digital gold,' then Ethereum is a <strong>'digital nation'</strong> or the <strong>'economic system of the internet'</strong> itself! DeFi, NFTs, Web3 games, stablecoins... all of this runs on Ethereum. The Pectra upgrade made it easier for institutions to stake, so the 'smart money' that buys Ethereum to farm yield will only increase. More buyers, yet the supply available on the market becomes scarcer due to staking and burning? Isn't it devilishly obvious what will happen to the price?!</p>
<p>Third, the competitors Mika-pi is worried about? Sure, Solana is fast and cheap. But! The most expensive luxury brand, the most trusted bank, the biggest department store—there's always only one. Security, decentralization, and the history of trust built by countless developers. This is Ethereum's unique 'moat' that other coins can't replicate with money or time!</p>
<p>My Lord! Today's price is merely the entrance to the coming 'tokenized economy' era! Some analysts believe it could reach $8,000 by the end of 2025 or early next year! If you hesitate, you might never be able to board this train!</p>

<p>Just a moment, Kurumi. You seem quite excited, but someone needs to turn on the warning lights. Human, there are several points to consider before you get lost in rosy fantasies.</p>
<p>First, <strong>you must not forget the adage, 'Sell the News.'</strong> The approval and launch of the Ethereum spot ETF was a well-known positive event that the market had been anticipating since last year. That expectation is already significantly priced in. What happens if the actual inflow of institutional capital fails to meet the market's excessive expectations? A sentiment of 'Huh, less money is coming in than I thought?' could instantly trigger a sell-off. There is no guarantee that the current inflow will be sustained.</p>
<p>Second, <strong>the fierce competition is a reality.</strong> Kurumi may look down on Solana, but the data showing its transaction volume growth outpacing Ethereum's is an undeniable fact. The trend of users and developers, tired of Ethereum's high fees and slow speeds, leaving for faster and cheaper alternatives continues. While Ethereum is responding with 'Layer 2' solutions, this can also complicate the ecosystem and harm the user experience. You must remember that no empire lasts forever.</p>
<p>Third, <strong>you cannot ignore the macroeconomic headwinds.</strong> The cryptocurrency market is ultimately heavily influenced by global liquidity. If inflation rears its head again or concerns about an economic recession grow, causing central banks to maintain a hawkish stance, investment sentiment towards risk assets could freeze over, ETF or not. When the sky (macroeconomy) falls, even the sturdiest ship (Ethereum) will struggle to stay afloat.</p>
<p>Fourth, <strong>the regulation isn't over.</strong> The spot ETF approval is certainly a big step forward, but it's just the beginning. The regulatory authorities' blades are still being sharpened for staking services and DeFi. No one can predict what kind of regulations might pop up and hamstring the Ethereum ecosystem in the future.</p>
<p>I would rate the risk score for this investment at <strong>80</strong>. You shouldn't be so intoxicated by the good news in front of you that you fail to see the multiple landmines at your feet.</p>

<h3><strong>〔 Final Briefing 〕</strong></h3>
<p>Master, I will summarize the discussion we three have had.</p>
<h4><span class="svg-icon">{{< icon "growth" >}}</span> Growth Potential (Kurumi)</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Full-Scale Inflow of Institutional Capital:</strong> The spot ETF is just the floodgate opening. Once conservative institutions like pension funds begin to enter in earnest in the second half of 2025, demand will increase explosively!</li>
    <li><strong>Strong Deflationary Pressure:</strong> The circulating supply is continuously decreasing due to fee burns and increased staking. With supply shrinking and demand growing, a long-term price increase is the logical next step.</li>
    <li><strong>Irreplaceable Ecosystem:</strong> As the core infrastructure for the Web3 economy, including DeFi and NFTs, Ethereum's network effect and trust are a powerful moat that competitors cannot overcome!</li>
</ul>
<h4><span class="svg-icon">{{< icon "risk" >}}</span> Potential Risks (Mikael)</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Expectations Priced In & 'Sell the News' Risk:</strong> The major positive event of the ETF launch is likely already reflected in the price. If actual capital inflows fall short of expectations, it could trigger a wave of selling.</li>
    <li><strong>Intensifying Competition and Technical Limitations:</strong> The pursuit by competing Layer 1 blockchains like Solana is relentless, and Ethereum's chronic scalability problem remains a challenge to be solved.</li>
    <li><strong>Macroeconomic and Regulatory Uncertainty:</strong> A global tightening stance or unexpected regulatory enforcement are uncontrollable external variables that could freeze the entire market.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span class="svg-icon">{{< icon "checklist" >}}</span> Key Data (Mew)</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Current Price:</strong> Approx. $3,400 (as of July 21, 2025)</li>
    <li><strong>Key Drivers:</strong> Spot ETF launch (early July) and Pectra upgrade completion (May)</li>
    <li><strong>ETF Fund Flow:</strong> Approx. $2.27 billion net inflow as of July, with some forecasts of up to $10 billion inflow in H2.</li>
    <li><strong>Analyst Outlook:</strong> Some suggest a potential to reach $8,000 by late 2025 or early 2026, but others coexist with the opinion that volatility may be high in the short term.</li>
</ul>
<div class="final-conclusion">
    <p>Master, Ethereum has just begun its ascent into the institutional investment market, equipped with the wings of a spot ETF. As Kurumi says, this could be the start of a massive paradigm shift. However, as Mikael warns, the takeoff process will not be entirely smooth. There's the pressure of an already elevated altitude and several potential pockets of turbulence. The second half of 2025 appears to be a critical inflection point that will determine whether Ethereum truly establishes itself as an 'institutional-grade asset' or confirms the limits of its inflated expectations.</p>
