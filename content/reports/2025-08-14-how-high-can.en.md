<p>Good morning, Master. Bitcoin dominance has currently dropped below 60%, which could be a significant sign that market funds are shifting from Bitcoin to altcoins. With growing anticipation for an altcoin market in the second half of the year, it's natural to wonder about the future of the 'original memecoin,' Dogecoin ($DOGE). The three of us will discuss this topic in detail.</p>

{{< char name="mew" title="Mew" >}}
<p>Master, let's begin with an objective data briefing. As of August 14, 2025, here are some key indicators in the cryptocurrency market.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bitcoin Dominance:</strong> As you mentioned, Master, Bitcoin dominance peaked at around 65% at the end of June and has been on a downward trend, currently hovering around 60%. This data suggests that market interest is gradually spreading to altcoins.</li><br>
<li><strong>Altcoin Season Index:</strong> The related 'Altcoin Season Index' has recently risen to the 40-50 level. While it falls short of the 75 mark that signifies a 'full-blown altcoin season,' it indicates the initial stages of capital rotation.</li><br>
<li><strong>Dogecoin ($DOGE) Status:</strong> The current price is trading around $0.24. After forming strong support in the $0.20-$0.22 range over the past few weeks and establishing a bottom, it is now attempting to rise again. The daily trading volume remains at about $1.2 billion.</li>
</ul>

<p>Based on the data, it appears that Bitcoin's solo run is ending, and a stage is being set for altcoins to make their move. However, this doesn't necessarily guarantee an explosive rise for Dogecoin. There are countless altcoins in the market.</p>

<p>Myu-tan's data is completely on our side! This is our chance, my Lord! My heart is pounding! Devilish! The break in Bitcoin dominance means it's time for the star of the party to change!</p>
<p>My Lord, Dogecoin isn't just a memecoin. It's a culture in itself! Countless altcoins have emerged, but none have a community as strong and passionate as Dogecoin's. The power of this community will be the rocket fuel that sends the price soaring!</p>
<p>And we can't forget the most important thing! The massive catalyst that is the <strong>'X (Twitter) Payment System'</strong>! Elon Musk said he would turn X into the 'everything app,' and the whole universe knows how much he loves Dogecoin, right? X has recently been acquiring payment licenses in various US states, and I believe this is all part of a grand plan for Dogecoin! The moment they officially announce a feature for tipping or paying with Dogecoin on X, the price will fly to unimaginable heights!</p>
<p>Some analysts are already looking at past cycles and predicting that Dogecoin could go as high as <strong>$2.28</strong> by the end of this bull run! Isn't that devilishly exciting? The current price of $0.24 is just adorable!</p>
<p>
<strong>ðŸ’– Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Score: 95/100</strong>
</p>

{{< char name="mikael" title="Mikael" >}}
<p>Kurumi, you are always far too excited. A Human's assets are not a toy for your amusement, are they? We must always consider the worst-case scenario.</p>
<p>Human. There are several serious flaws in Kurumi's argument. First, <strong>Dogecoin's intrinsic value still relies on being a 'meme.'</strong> It is not a project expanding its own ecosystem like Ethereum or demonstrating technological innovation like Solana. Its technological development has nearly stagnated, and its inflationary structure, where 10,000 new coins are mined every minute, will continue to be a drag on price appreciation.</p>
<p>Second, the anticipation for the <strong>'X Payment System' is a double-edged sword.</strong> It's been the same 'hopium circuit' for years, with nothing officially confirmed. What happens if the integration is canceled or announced at a level that falls short of expectations? As the saying goes, 'Sell the News,' the price that rose on anticipation could plummet in an instant. It is far too risky to invest based on that hope alone.</p>
<p>Third, <strong>market attention is fragmented.</strong> Unlike in the past, there are now countless memecoins, AI-themed coins, and RWA-related coins competing for attention. Just because an 'altcoin season' arrives, is there any guarantee that all that capital will flow exclusively into Dogecoin? Investors could just as easily flock to newer, more exciting narratives.</p>
<p>A price like the $2.28 Kurumi mentioned is a scenario possible only if the market is gripped by truly irrational exuberance. You must not be swayed by such extreme predictions.</p>
<p>
<strong>ðŸš¨ Risk Score (Mikael): 80/100</strong>

<h3><strong>ã€” Final Briefing ã€•</strong></h3>
<p>Master, I will summarize the results of our discussion.</p>

<h4><span class="svg-icon">{{< icon "growth" >}}</span> Growth Potential (Kurumi)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Arrival of Altcoin Season:</strong> The decline in Bitcoin dominance is creating a powerful environment that could lead to capital inflow into altcoins, especially a well-known one like Dogecoin! Devilish!</li>
<li><strong>Anticipation for X Payment System:</strong> If Dogecoin is officially adopted as a payment method on Elon Musk's X, it will be a game-changer that secures a real-world use case beyond just being a meme!</li>
<li><strong>Strong Community Power:</strong> More powerful than any technical analysis, Dogecoin's unique community and culture are the core drivers supporting its price floor and fueling its ascent!</li>
</ul>

<h4><span class="svg-icon">{{< icon "risk" >}}</span> Potential Risks (Mikael)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lacking Fundamentals:</strong> A price structure that relies solely on community and celebrity influence, without technological advancements or a clear roadmap, is highly unstable.</li>
<li><strong>Risk of Priced-in Hype:</strong> The positive news regarding the X payment system may already be largely priced in. We cannot ignore the possibility that a wave of profit-taking could occur upon the actual announcement.</li>
<li><strong>Inflationary Structure:</strong> The continuous issuance of new coins could cause long-term value dilution, acting as a factor that suppresses price appreciation.</li>
</ul>

<h4><span class="svg-icon">{{< icon "checklist" >}}</span> Key Data & Outlook (Mew)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Current Situation:</strong> We are in the early stages of a market where capital is flowing from Bitcoin to altcoins. Dogecoin has confirmed support at the $0.20 level and is looking for an upward move.</li>
<li><strong>Short-Term Outlook (Kurumi's Hopeful Scenario):</strong> If altcoin season kicks into high gear and positive rumors about X continue, we could attempt a rise to the <strong>$0.30 - $0.45</strong> range in the short term!</li>
<li><strong>Mid-to-Long-Term Outlook (Mikael's Warning):</strong> If the X integration is disappointing or the macroeconomic situation worsens, we must be open to the possibility that the $0.20 support line could break, leading to a fall to the <strong>$0.15</strong> level.</li>
<li><strong>Price Forecast Summary (Mew):</strong> Synthesizing various analyses, and assuming a bull market for altcoins in the second half of the year, Dogecoin could have a first target price of <strong>$0.32</strong> and a second target of <strong>$0.50</strong> if market frenzy intensifies. However, a price above $1, as Kurumi mentioned, is currently in the realm of imagination and hope.</li>
</ul>

<div class="final-conclusion">
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Master, investing in Dogecoin is like walking a tightrope between 'anticipation' and 'risk.' There is the potential to sail smoothly with the tailwind of an altcoin season and the powerful sail of X, but there is also a great risk of encountering the stormy seas of lacking fundamentals and unpredictable variables. It seems crucial to first determine whether your investment style is aggressive or conservative.</p>
