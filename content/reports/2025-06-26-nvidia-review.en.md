<p>Hello, Master. Let's begin today's analysis on Nvidia ($NVDA), which has just 'hit an all-time high'.</p>

{{< char name="mew" title="Mew" >}}
<p>Master, I will first brief you on the data regarding Nvidia's current situation. As of June 26, 2025, Nvidia's stock has recently broken its historical record, surpassing a $3 trillion market capitalization and becoming one of the most valuable companies in the world.</p>
<p>Here are some key data points.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Stock Performance:</strong> Over the past year, Nvidia's stock has risen by more than 200%. The explosive growth of the generative AI market has been the core driver of this stock price increase.</li><br>
    <li><strong>Market Dominance:</strong> In the AI accelerator market for data centers, Nvidia's share exceeds 80%, a level that is nearly a monopoly. The powerful CUDA software ecosystem further solidifies this dominance.</li><br>
    <li><strong>Financial Health:</strong> The most recent quarterly earnings report showed phenomenal growth, with data center revenue increasing by 427% year-over-year. The gross profit margin also surpassed 78%, proving its overwhelming profitability.</li><br>
    <li><strong>Valuation:</strong> However, reflecting these high expectations, the valuation is at a high level. The 12-month forward price-to-earnings (Forward P/E) ratio is around 40x, significantly above the S&P 500 average of 21x.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let's start the discussion based on this data.</p>

{{< char name="kurumi" title="Kurumi" >}}
<p>Thanks for the data, Myu-tan! Did you hear that, my Lord? <strong>A 427% growth in data center revenue!</strong> This is just the beginning of a revolution! This is no time to hesitate just because it's at an all-time high!</p>
<p>I think this is just the start! Why? Because AI has only just begun to change the world! Every industry, every company is scrambling to adopt AI, and what do they need to run that AI? That's right, <strong>Nvidia's GPUs</strong>! It's like selling jeans during the Gold Rush. When everyone is digging for gold, the ones making the surest money are those selling jeans and pickaxes!</p>
<p>Besides, Nvidia isn't just a chip company. Its CUDA software platform acts as a powerful 'moat' that prevents developers from switching to other chips. Once a developer gets used to CUDA, it's devilishly difficult to move to another ecosystem.</p>
<p>And the upcoming 'Blackwell' platform is said to far surpass the performance of the current Hopper architecture. This is like Nvidia sprinting further ahead just as its competitors are struggling to catch up! Every time a new chip comes out, Nvidia's revenue and profits will jump again!</p>
<p><strong>ðŸ’– Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Investment Score: 95/100</strong><br>
<blockquote>
This bull run isn't a bubble; it's the celebratory cannon fire heralding the dawn of the AI age! If you hesitate, you'll just miss the opportunity!</p>

<p>Kurumi, your burning passion is like the brimstone of the underworld. But a Human's assets can turn to ash in an instant if thrown into such a hot place.</p>
<p>Human, listening to Kurumi makes it sound like you should bet everything immediately. But in my eyes, I see several clear warning signs.</p>
<p>First, the <strong>extreme valuation</strong>. As Mew said, the forward P/E is at 40x. This could mean that the market has already priced in all of its tremendous future growth. What happens if that growth falls even slightly short of market expectations? The stock price could fall off a cliff. We must not forget the adage, 'no tree grows to the sky.'</p>
<p>Second, <strong>intensifying competition</strong>. Nvidia's current dominance will not last forever. AMD is already catching up with competing products like the MI300X, and Intel has thrown down the gauntlet with its Gaudi chip. What's more frightening are the 'enemies from within.' Big tech companies like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft are developing their own custom AI chips. These companies are also Nvidia's biggest customers. Is there any scenario more terrifying than your customers turning into your direct competitors?</p>
<p>Third, <strong>geopolitical risk</strong>. The production of Nvidia's most advanced chips relies heavily on TSMC in Taiwan. If U.S.-China tensions worsen or military tensions rise in the Taiwan Strait, the entire production line could come to a halt. This is a fatal risk that lies outside the company's control.</p>
<p>Fourth, <strong>regulatory risk</strong>. The U.S. government is already controlling the export of advanced semiconductors to China. If these regulations tighten, a portion of Nvidia's potential market disappears. Its monopolistic position could itself become a target for antitrust regulations from governments around the world.</p>
<p>I want to warn you that this investment may look like a sweet fruit wine, but it could, in fact, be a poisoned chalice.</p>
<p><strong>ðŸš¨ Mikael's Risk Score: 80/100</strong><br>
<blockquote>
Human, you must not be so intoxicated by the rosy future that you fail to see the pitfall at your feet.</p>

{{< char name="kurumi" title="Kurumi" >}}
<p>Hmph, raining on parades is Mika-pi's specialty! But those are such obvious worries!</p>
<p>It's natural for competitors to appear. That's proof of how attractive this market is! But everyone is underestimating Nvidia's CUDA ecosystem. Countless AI models and software have been developed on CUDA, and moving all of that to a different chip overnight is next to impossible. This isn't just a hardware race; it's an ecosystem war!</p>
<p>And Big Tech making their own chips? Of course, they will! But those will be for specific uses, optimized for their own services. For general-purpose, high-performance AI chips, Nvidia will still be the best and most efficient! Not every company can develop its own chip, so they'll have no choice but to line up for Nvidia's!</p>
<p>Geopolitical risk? That's a common risk for all semiconductor companies, not just Nvidia's problem!</p>

{{< char name="mikael" title="Mikael" >}}
<p>Kurumi, do you realize how irresponsible that phrase 'common risk' sounds? While the risk may be common, the impact could be far greater for Nvidia due to its high valuation. The higher the stock climbs, the more painful the fall.</p>
<p>It's true that the CUDA ecosystem is powerful. But if we look at history, no empire lasts forever. Think of Nokia's Symbian in the smartphone market, or the countless technical standards that collapsed in the face of better alternatives. There are already movements by competitors to form alliances and build an open-source ecosystem to move away from CUDA. Change can happen faster than we think.</p>

<p>Both of you, please calm down. You are confusing the Master. I will now provide a final briefing summarizing the discussion so far.</p>

{{< briefing >}}
<h3><strong>ã€” Final Briefing ã€•</strong></h3>
<p>Master, I'll summarize our three opinions. Investing in Nvidia can be seen as an opportunity to ride the massive wave of the AI revolution, but at the same time, it's like surfing precariously on top of that high wave.</p>

<h4><span class="svg-icon">{{< icon "growth" >}}</span> Growth Potential (Kurumi's Perspective)</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Structural Growth of the AI Market:</strong> As AI is applied to all industries, the demand for GPUs, which are essential for training and operating AI models, is bound to increase explosively!</li>
    <li><strong>A Powerful Technological Moat:</strong> The CUDA software ecosystem is a formidable competitive advantage that rivals cannot catch up to in the short term, acting as a strong lock-in for customers!</li>
    <li><strong>Continuous Innovation:</strong> Next-generation chips like the upcoming Blackwell will further widen the technology gap, ensuring Nvidia maintains its dominant position!</li>
</ul>

<h4><span class="svg-icon">{{< icon "risk" >}}</span> Potential Risks (Mikael's Perspective)</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>High Valuation Burden:</strong> The current stock price excessively reflects a rosy future outlook, creating a risk of a sharp decline in response to even minor setbacks.</li>
    <li><strong>Intensifying Competition & Potential Customer Defection:</strong> Not only AMD and Intel but also major customers like Google and Amazon are developing their own chips, which could threaten Nvidia's market share.</li>
    <li><strong>Geopolitical and Regulatory Risks:</strong> High dependency on Taiwan's TSMC for production, escalating U.S.-China tensions, and antitrust regulations from various governments are uncontrollable external variables.</li>
</ul>

<h4><span class="svg-icon">{{< icon "checklist" >}}</span> Core Data (Mew's Perspective)</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Current Valuation:</strong> Forward P/E of approx. 40x and Price-to-Sales Ratio (PSR) of approx. 38x, both significantly exceeding market averages.</li>
    <li><strong>Wall Street Analyst Opinions:</strong> While many investment banks maintain a 'Buy' rating, there is a variance in price targets. Some voices are beginning to warn of overheating.</li>
    <li><strong>Market Growth Forecast:</strong> The AI chip market is projected to continue its high growth, with a CAGR of over 30% for the next few years. The question is how much of this growth Nvidia can capture exclusively.</li>
</ul>

<div class="final-conclusion">
    <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Master, Nvidia is the undisputed leader of the AI era and is demonstrating phenomenal growth. As Kurumi says, we may be at the very beginning of this revolution. However, as Mikael points out, the shadow is as deep as the light is bright. You must consider the risk of failing to meet high expectations, the intensifying competition, and the uncertainty of the external environment. Depending on your investment philosophy and risk tolerance, this investment could be the greatest opportunity or the most dangerous trap.</p>
