<p>Hello, Master. Today, we're going to discuss the hottest topic in the market: <strong>Bitcoin, which has just hit a new all-time high.</strong> With all eyes on it, the three of us will analyze what this phenomenon means for investors.</p>

{{< char name="mew" title="Mew" >}}
<p>Master, I will begin with an objective data briefing. On July 9, 2025, the price of Bitcoin surpassed <strong>$112,000</strong> per coin, setting a new all-time high (ATH). This is a new record, exceeding the previous high of $111,970 set this past May.</p>
{{< tv-chart ticker="BTCUSD" >}}
<p>Here are a few key indicators.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key Drivers:</strong> Several factors are contributing to this rally. First, capital from institutional investors, led by BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF, continues to flow in. Second, there is widespread anticipation of a more favorable regulatory environment, as U.S. government officials have recently hinted at the possibility of purchasing Bitcoin and building related infrastructure. Finally, overall market sentiment is extremely positive.</li><br>
<li><strong>Market Sentiment:</strong> The current Crypto 'Fear & Greed Index' is at <strong>71</strong>, indicating a state of <strong>'Greed'</strong>. While slightly down from last week's 73, it's still a figure that shows the market is leaning heavily toward optimism.</li><br>
<li><strong>Institutional Moves:</strong> The stock prices of companies with large Bitcoin holdings, such as MicroStrategy, are rising in tandem, indicating a favorable trend across all crypto-related assets.</li>
</ul>

<p>My Lord! This is absolutely huge! Devilish! Bitcoin has finally smashed through the $110,000 wall and soared into a new world! My heart feels like it's about to burst with joy! This is a re-evaluation of Bitcoin's value and the dawn of a new era!</p>
<p>Look at the data Myu-tan mentioned! This isn't some bubble created by retail investors piling in. The world's largest asset managers and corporations are bringing in real money, and there's even talk that the most powerful nation on earth, the United States, might add Bitcoin to its national assets! This is the starting gun, signaling that Bitcoin is finally gaining official recognition as 'digital gold'.</p>
<p>I bet Mika-pi will start singing her usual song about risk and bubbles, right? But this is on a different level from the frenzy of 2017 or 2021. Back then, it was all just a 'dream,' but now it's becoming 'reality.' Through spot ETFs, a path has opened for even conservative funds like pensions to buy Bitcoin, and if the stablecoin bill passes, the final shackles of regulatory uncertainty will be removed.</p>
<p>In a few years, today's $110,000 will be remembered as an unimaginably low price, my Lord! Hesitating here is like refusing to board a rocket to the moon when there's an empty seat waiting for you!</p>

<p>Kurumi, your excited voice sounds like a precarious siren to my ears.</p>
<p>Human, the louder the celebratory cannons, the more vigilant you must be. To my eyes, the current situation looks like a perilous festival held on the edge of a cliff called greed.</p>
<p>First, you must be wary of the 'expectations' trap. The possibilities Kurumi mentionedâ€”the U.S. government buying Bitcoin, the passage of a stablecoin billâ€”are all just 'projections' that have not yet materialized. It's highly likely that this rosy news is already fully, perhaps excessively, priced in. If even one of these expectations is delayed or fails, a flood of disappointed selling could cause the price to plummet in an instant. The adage 'buy the rumor, sell the news' exists for times like these.</p>
<p>Second, look at the 'Greed' index. The number 71 is clear evidence that market participants are losing their reason and are swept up in avarice. When everyone is drunk on optimism and wants to buy, who is left to buy it from them at an even higher price? Once new buying power is exhausted, even a small piece of bad news can trigger a panic sell-off as everyone rushes for the exit. It's the same principle I warned about when the S&P500 was in 'Extreme Greed'.</p>
<p>Third, you cannot ignore historical patterns. Bitcoin has always experienced a sharp correction after hitting a new all-time high. Can you be certain this time will be different? Just because institutional investors have entered the scene doesn't mean volatility has vanished. On the contrary, when their massive funds are withdrawn, the shock could be far greater than in the past.</p>
<p><strong>ðŸš¨ Mikael's Risk Score: 90/100</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now is not the time to ride the wave of greed, but to build a seawall in preparation for a tsunami that could strike at any moment. Focus on protecting your assets rather than chasing profits.</p>

<h3><strong>ã€” Final Briefing ã€•</strong></h3>
<p>Master, I will summarize the discussion for you.</p>

<h4><span class="svg-icon">{{< icon "growth" >}}</span> Growth Potential (Kurumi)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Full-Scale Institutional Entry:</strong> The continuous inflow of institutional capital through spot ETFs is the strongest signal that Bitcoin is being integrated into the mainstream financial system. A devilishly good sign!</li>
<li><strong>Favorable Regulatory Environment:</strong> The U.S. government's positive stance and expectations for regulatory clarity are boosting confidence in Bitcoin's long-term growth!</li>
<li><strong>A New Paradigm:</strong> This ATH breakthrough is different from the speculative frenzies of the past; it's a historic turning point where its value as 'digital gold' is being institutionally recognized.</li>
</ul>

<h4><span class="svg-icon">{{< icon "risk" >}}</span> Potential Risks (Mikael)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Over-Priced Expectations:</strong> Positive but unrealized news is already excessively priced in, increasing the risk of a sharp drop if expectations are not met.</li>
<li><strong>Extreme Market Sentiment:</strong> A market in the 'Greed' stage is vulnerable and can easily descend into panic from a small shock. The moment of greatest applause can be the moment of greatest danger.</li>
<li><strong>Possibility of Repeating Past Patterns:</strong> Historically, ATH breakthroughs have always been followed by significant corrections. The thought that 'this time is different' could come at a very high price.</li>
</ul>

<h4><span class="svg-icon">{{< icon "checklist" >}}</span> Key Data (Mew)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>All-Time High (ATH):</strong> Surpassed $112,000 (July 9, 2025)</li>
<li><strong>Market Sentiment Index:</strong> Fear & Greed Index at 71 ('Greed' stage)</li>
<li><strong>Key Variables:</strong> Continuation of institutional capital inflows, actual implementation of news related to U.S. government regulation.</li>
</ul>

<div class="final-conclusion">
<p>Master, Bitcoin has entered <strong>a price territory no one has ever seen before.</strong> As Kurumi said, institutional investment and shifting government attitudes could serve as powerful fundamentals, different from the past. However, as Mikael warned, the higher an asset soars, the greater the impact of its fall. Inflated expectations and greedy market sentiment are subjects for constant vigilance. Only time will tell if this rally is the dawn of a new era or another massive trap. I believe this is a time that calls for more careful consideration than ever.</p>
