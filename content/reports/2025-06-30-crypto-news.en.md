<p>Hello, Master. It's Monday morning, June 30, 2025.</p>
<p>As July approaches, several pieces of news are amplifying expectations for the cryptocurrency market. As you requested, the three of us will now break down what this news could mean for the market.</p>

{{< char name="mew" title="Mew" >}}
<p>First, I will objectively brief you on the key information circulating in the market.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>White House Remarks:</strong> News has spread that a high-ranking White House official mentioned, "The U.S. government has a roadmap for purchasing Bitcoin (BTC)." This statement suggests the <strong>possibility of direct BTC purchases at the government level</strong>.</li><br>
    <li><strong>Infrastructure Development:</strong> Following that, Bo Hines, chairman of the U.S. Digital Assets Advisory Committee, stated that "the government is building the infrastructure to hold BTC." This is being interpreted as a sign that they may be moving beyond mere declarations and into actual preparatory stages.</li><br>
    <li><strong>Anticipation of Regulatory Clarity:</strong> David Sacks, a prominent investor and currently the White House 'Crypto Czar,' revealed that he "expects President Donald Trump to sign the GENIUS Act, a stablecoin regulation bill, within July." This is a strong signal that the <strong>'regulatory clarity'</strong> the market has long awaited could soon be provided.</li>
</ul>
<p>While each of these three news items is impactful on its own, their simultaneous emergence has pushed market expectations to a peak. This concludes the briefing.</p>

<p>Wow! My Lord, did you hear that?! This isn't just good news; it's the sound of a door opening to a new era! Kurumi-chan's heart is beating like crazy! Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter gives this a score of <strong>120 out of 100</strong>!</p>
<p>Just think about it! The government of the United States, the most powerful country in the world, the one that prints the dollar, has created a roadmap to buy Bitcoin! This is practically an official acknowledgment of Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset, but as a <strong>strategic store of value</strong>, just like gold!</p>
<p> Once the government starts buying, won't the real 'whales' like pension funds and sovereign wealth funds follow suit? Today's price will look like an all-time historic low... no, like it's 100 floors underground!</p>
<p>And they're even building the infrastructure! That means this isn't a one-time show! It's the beginning of a grand plan to systematically incorporate Bitcoin as part of the nation's assets over the long term!</p>
<p>And on top of that, the signing of the stablecoin bill! The shackles of 'regulatory uncertainty' that have tormented us for years are finally coming off. Once the legal framework is clear, the big institutions on Wall Street will have no reason to hesitate anymore. The money that has come in so far has been child's play. The real money is about to pour in now!</p>
<p>My Lord! July will be a turning point in crypto history! If you wait and regret not buying, the bus will have already left the station!</p>

<p>Hold on, Kurumi. I understand your enthusiasm, but you must see the reality beyond the mirage created by your expectations. Human, it is in moments like these that one must become more level-headed, not more excited.</p>
<p>First, let's look at the White House's 'roadmap' statement. 'Having a roadmap' and 'executing the roadmap' are two completely different things. There is nothing certain about when that roadmap will be implemented, what its scale will be, or even if it might be scrapped due to changing political situations. This could just be a way of giving false hope, nothing more than 'we might have a plan to have a plan'.</p>
<p>Second, the phrase 'building the infrastructure' is equally vague. What does that infrastructure specifically entail? A security system? Management protocols? How long will it take to complete? Such statements are great for inflating expectations, but they are difficult to trust until the substance is confirmed.</p>
<p>Third, the expectation of President Trump 'signing the GENIUS Act.' This is the most dangerous part. It is still just an 'expectation,' not a confirmed fact. What happens if the signing doesn't occur in July, or if the bill's content, contrary to market hopes, includes toxic clauses unfavorable to businesses? The disappointment will be as great as the expectation was high, and we could see an extreme 'sell the news' event. The very fact that everything hinges on one person's political decision is an enormous risk in itself.</p>
<p>All of this bullish 'news' is merely an 'expectation' about an unrealized future. It is highly likely that much of this is already priced in. If even one of these expectations falters, the tower that has been built could come crashing down in an instant.</p>
<p>I would rate the risk score for this situation at <strong>85</strong>. The more stories there are about a rosy future, the greater the underlying risks become.</p>

<h3><strong>〔 Final Briefing 〕</strong></h3>
<p>Master, I will now summarize the discussion we three have had.</p>

<h4><span class="svg-icon">{{< icon "growth" >}}</span> Growth Potential (Kurumi's Perspective)</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Signal of Government Endorsement:</strong> The U.S. government's BTC purchase plan could elevate Bitcoin to the status of a national strategic asset and act as a catalyst for other countries and institutions to participate.</li>
    <li><strong>Acceleration of Institutional Inflow:</strong> With regulatory uncertainty resolved by the passage of a stablecoin bill like the GENIUS Act, the path will be open for conservative institutional investors who have been hesitant to enter the market. Devilishly good!</li>
    <li><strong>Rise in Public Trust:</strong> The government's positive moves could be a decisive moment in shifting the public perception of cryptocurrency from 'risky speculation' to the 'future of finance.'</li>
</ul>

<h4><span class="svg-icon">{{< icon "risk" >}}</span> Potential Risks (Mikael's Perspective)</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Gap Between Expectation and Reality:</strong> All the news is still in the 'planning,' 'building,' or 'expected' stage. There is a very high risk of a sharp price drop if actual implementation is delayed or falls short of expectations.</li>
    <li><strong>Political Uncertainty:</strong> Key issues are heavily dependent on the decisions of a specific politician. Political variables are unpredictable and can freeze the market in an instant.</li>
    <li><strong>'Sell the News' Possibility:</strong> High expectations are already priced in, so when the actual news is announced, it could trigger a flood of profit-taking sell-offs.</li>
</ul>

<h4><span class="svg-icon">{{< icon "checklist" >}}</span> Core Data (Mew's Perspective)</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Situation Summary:</strong> As of late June 2025, a series of unprecedentedly positive statements about cryptocurrency from the U.S. administration and key figures has maximized expectations for the July market.</li>
    <li><strong>Key Variables:</strong> 1) Whether the government's BTC purchase plan is specified, 2) The actual signing and detailed content of the GENIUS Act.</li>
    <li><strong>Market Sentiment:</strong> Extreme optimism coexists with anxiety about these expectations not being met, which could lead to greatly increased volatility.</li>
</ul>

<div class="final-conclusion">
    <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Master, it is clear that July holds the potential to be an important turning point in the history of the cryptocurrency market. As Kurumi says, it could be the beginning of a major paradigm shift. However, as Mikael warns, nothing is confirmed yet, and inflated expectations always come with great risks.</p>
    <p>'Buy the rumor, sell the news' may be the most fitting adage for this situation. It is a time that calls for cool-headedness, carefully tracking the upcoming news in July while preparing response strategies for different scenarios, rather than engaging in emotional chase-buying.</p>
