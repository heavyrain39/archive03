The horizontal lines drawn on a chart, so-called 'support' and 'resistance.' Looking at them, they can seem like a secret map to the future. But how reliable are they really? The three of us will debate the credibility of this fundamental concept in technical analysis.\\nMew\\rMaster, first, I will brief you on what 'Support' and 'Resistance' are from a data perspective. This isn't magic; it can be described as the footprint of collective psychology.\\nSupport Level: This is a price level where a stock, after falling, tends to stop or bounce back up. At this point, the buying pressure from those who think 'it's cheap enough now' becomes stronger than the selling pressure from those who think 'it will fall further,' causing demand to outpace supply. It is formed by connecting previous low points where the price has repeatedly hit and rebounded.\\rResistance Level: This is a price level where a stock, after rising, tends to stop or fall back down. At this point, the selling pressure from those who think 'it's too expensive now' (profit-taking or loss-cutting) becomes stronger than the buying pressure from those who think 'it will rise further,' causing supply to exceed demand. It is formed by connecting previous high points where breakouts have repeatedly failed.\\rThe psychological background for the formation of these lines is simple. For example, let's assume a stock fell from $100 to $80 and then rose back to $100.\\nPeople who regretted not buying at $80 will place buy orders when the price approaches $80 again, thinking, 'This is my chance!' (forming a support line).\\rPeople who regretted not selling at $100 will place sell orders when the price approaches $100 again, thinking, 'I'm breaking even!' (forming a resistance line).\\rThe memories and emotions of these investors converge at specific price points, creating support and resistance. The important thing is that a broken resistance line tends to become a support line, and a broken support line tends to become a resistance line.\\nKurumi\\rMyu-tan's explanation is so stiff! My Lord, these aren't just lines; they're like a treasure map for reading the market's psychology! I absolutely adore these lines!\\nFirst, it's a 'Self-fulfilling Prophecy'! Countless investors worldwide are looking at the same charts and drawing the same support and resistance lines. As a result, buy orders actually flood in at the support line where everyone thinks, \\\"It will probably bounce back here,\\\" and sell orders flood in at the resistance line where everyone thinks, \\\"It will probably get blocked here.\\\" It's a magical event where the prophecy comes true! Devilish!\\nSecond, knowing this makes it much easier to time your trades!\\nNear the support line: The price has come down to the support line? It could be a 'bargain sale' opportunity! If you bravely buy here, you can make a profit when it rebounds!\\rNear the resistance line: The price has hit the resistance line? It's a signal to take profits without getting greedy!\\rBreaking the resistance line: If it breaks through a strong resistance line? That's the signal for a new era! That's when you should chase the trend and aim for a bigger rise!\\rOf course, it's not 100%, but it's a powerful weapon that allows you to play a game with a much higher win rate than investing without any criteria! This is a work of art created by the collective anxiety and greed of market participants!\\n💖 Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Score: 85/100\\nA chart is a picture drawn by all market participants together! If you can read the flow of the picture, you can see the money!\\nMikael\\rKurumi, have you ever considered that your treasure map might actually be a mirage? Human, blindly trusting those lines is a very dangerous act. I would like to point out a few fatal traps.\\nFirst, there is the trap of subjectivity. Support and resistance lines are not as clear-cut as if measured with a ruler. One person might connect recent lows, while another includes lows from further in the past. It also changes depending on whether you use the candle's body or its wick as a reference. It's a perfect tool for falling into 'Confirmation Bias,' where you draw the line however you want to see it and justify your investment decisions.\\nSecond, this is all just past data. Technical analysis is based on the assumption that past price movements will repeat in the future. However, if unexpected news that changes the market's fundamental value breaks (e.g., earnings announcements, interest rate hikes, war, etc.), past support and resistance lines become as useless as scrap paper and are easily broken.\\nThird, there is the trap of a 'False Breakout.' Market makers exploit this mass psychology. They intentionally push the price just above a resistance line to induce retail investors to chase the stock, then dump all their shares, causing the price to crash. Conversely, they might slightly break a support line to scoop up the shares of panicked retail investors who are selling at a loss, and then drive the price up.\\nThese lines are not a crystal ball for predicting the future. It is wise to use them merely as a reference, thinking, 'A psychological battle might be fierce at this price level,' and as a standard for risk management. For example, for establishing a principle like, 'If the support line breaks, my judgment was wrong, so I will cut my losses.'\\n🚨 Mikael's Risk Score: 70/100\\nPast footprints do not guarantee the future path. You must remember that there can always be a cliff next to those footprints.\\n〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, I will summarize the discussion we three have had.\\nPractical Value (Kurumi)\\rGauging Market Psychology: By identifying the price levels that many investors consider important, you can use it as a measure to read the market's collective sentiment.\\rTiming Trades: It provides a reference point for setting specific entry/exit strategies, such as buying at support, selling at resistance, or chasing a breakout.\\rSelf-Fulfilling Effect: Because many investors refer to them, the probability that the price will actually react near these lines is statistically significant.\\rPotential Risks (Mikael)\\rDanger of Blind Faith: If you invest by treating support/resistance as an absolute law, you can suffer significant losses from unexpected market changes or 'false breakouts.'\\rTrap of Subjective Interpretation: The way lines are drawn varies from person to person, so it can be misused as a tool to reinforce one's own beliefs rather than as an objective indicator.\\rLimitation of Lagging Indicators: Being based on past data, it cannot reflect new information or events that change the market paradigm at all.\\rCore Data (Mew)\\rDefinition: A specific price range (Zone) where the balance between buying and selling pressure tends to shift, representing a concentration of investor psychology.\\rEssence: It is not a scientific law, but a probabilistic tool based on collective psychology and self-fulfilling prophecies.\\rRecommended Use:\\rIts reliability increases when used in conjunction with other analytical tools like volume, moving averages, and secondary indicators, rather than in isolation.\\rIt is more realistic to perceive it as a 'Zone' with a certain width, rather than a precise 'Line.'\\rIt is far more useful as a standard for risk management, such as setting a 'stop-loss line,' than for predicting the future.\\rMaster, in conclusion, to the question 'How reliable are support and resistance lines?' the answer is 'Their reliability depends on how you use them.' If you believe in them as an absolute prophecy of the future, they become a perilous gamble. However, if you use them as a reference to understand the psychological state of market participants and as a standard for setting your own investment principles, they can be a very useful analytical tool.\\n\"" }

            { "title": "An ETF That Pays Cash Weekly? An In-Depth Look at $MAGY\u0027s Pros and Cons", "permalink": "https:\/\/archive03.online\/en\/reports\/2025-09-27-an-etf-that\/", "date": "2025-09-27", "formattedDate": "25.09.27", "content": "\"Master, you've brought an interesting ETF. You mean $MAGY, right? Since it contains the hottest 'Magnificent Seven' stocks in the market right now, it's no surprise that it's drawing investor attention. Let's examine whether this ETF will deliver 'magical' returns or if it's just a dangerous illusion.\\nMew\\rMaster, I will begin the briefing. $MAGY might be a little different from what you think. It's not simply a product that gathers the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks. Its official name is the 'Roundhill Magnificent Seven Covered Call ETF.' As the name suggests, it's an active ETF that uses a Covered Call strategy.\\nI will summarize the key data for you.\\nBasic Structure: $MAGY operates using another ETF, $MAGS, which invests in the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, Tesla), as its underlying asset. It employs a 'covered call' strategy by holding this underlying asset while simultaneously selling call options.\\nInvestment Goal: The core of this strategy is to forgo a portion of the capital gains from stock price appreciation. In return, it consistently collects the option premium (the price for selling the option) and pays it out to investors as a high dividend (distribution). This ETF even aims to pay distributions weekly.\\nKey Metrics (as of September 26, 2025):\\rInception Date: April 23, 2025, making it a relatively new ETF with a short track record.\\rAssets Under Management (AUM): Approximately $105.5 million.\\rExpense Ratio: The Net Expense Ratio is 0.99% per year, which is quite high compared to typical passive ETFs.\\rDistribution Yield: The estimated annual distribution yield, based on recent payouts, is around a very high 12.7%.\\rIn summary, $MAGY is a very unique product concept that bets on the explosive growth of the 'Magnificent Seven' while simultaneously aiming to generate weekly cash flow through a covered call strategy.\\nKurumi\\rMy Lord! Isn't this the dream combination?! Investing in the seven sexiest stocks leading world innovation while receiving a weekly 'stock rent' that puts bank interest to shame! My heart is about to explode! Devilish!\\nFirst, it's a greedy strategy that catches two birds with one stone: growth and dividends! Usually, growth stock investing has almost no dividends, so it can be boring just waiting for the stock price to go up, right? But with this, you can invest in the heart-pounding future of AI, cloud, and electric vehicles, while also enjoying the pleasure of cash hitting your account every week! There's no time to be bored!\\nSecond, it gives you the strength to endure downturns! Of course, since it's a covered call, you won't capture all the gains when the stock price skyrockets. But think about it the other way! When the stock price is sluggish or drops a little, we can still smile while receiving our regular dividend payments. We can use this dividend money to buy tasty treats, or reinvest it to enjoy the effects of compounding! It's like a sturdy shield that protects your mentality in a bear market!\\nThird, it's a concentrated investment in only the top players! It's on a different level from the S\\u0026P 500, which mixes in all sorts of riff-raff. This is literally like investing only in the 'Avengers' team. Nobody thinks these seven market-dominating companies will go bankrupt, right? Look at this cleverness—riding the most powerful horses while securing a stable cash flow!\\n💖 Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Score: 85/100\\nMy Lord, this is a magic box that eliminates the boredom of investing! Getting a weekly allowance while riding a rocket to the future? I can't resist this!\\nMikael\\rKurumi, you always speak only of the sweetness of the candy, completely failing to see the risk of cavities hidden behind it. Human, I have detected several serious risk signals from this ETF.\\nFirst, this is an extreme risk packaged as 'concentration.' This product directly violates the principle of diversification. You are entrusting all your assets to the fate of just seven technology companies, companies with very high stock price volatility at that. The moment one or two of these companies face a regulatory crackdown or fall behind in technological innovation, the entire ETF could plummet. This isn't just putting all your eggs in one basket; it's like precariously holding seven eggs in one hand.\\nSecond, you must understand the trap of 'high dividends.' The essence of a covered call strategy is the act of 'selling your upside potential.' If a period of explosive growth comes for the Magnificent Seven stocks, this ETF will miss out on most of those gains. You might console yourself by saying, 'It's okay, I received my dividends,' but you will feel a sense of relative deprivation watching the massive capital gains other investors are making. In the long run, it's highly likely to underperform simply tracking the index itself.\\nThird, you must not overlook the high expense ratio. A figure of 0.99% per year is by no means low. It means that 1% of your assets disappear as fees every year, even if you do nothing. This cost will seriously erode the compounding effect of a long-term investment. You must not be dazzled by the high dividend yield and forget this obvious cost.\\nFinally, this is a newborn ETF. It has not yet properly experienced a market downturn cycle. No one has verified whether its current strategy will remain effective in a highly volatile market.\\n🚨 Mikael's Risk Score: 80/100\\nDo not become a moth drawn to the flame of a flashy dividend yield. Behind that light lies the scorching price of concentration risk and the loss of growth potential.\\n〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, I will summarize the results of our discussion.\\nGrowth Potential (Kurumi)\\rCombination of Growth and Income: It has a unique structure that allows you to invest in the growth of the world's top tech stocks while simultaneously generating weekly cash flow!\\rPsychological Stability: Since a steady distribution is paid even when the stock price moves sideways or declines, it can serve as a psychological anchor to endure volatility and continue long-term investing.\\rPotential Risks (Mikael)\\rExtreme Concentration Risk: Everything depends on just seven stocks, so there is no diversification. It is extremely vulnerable when a crisis hits a specific company or the entire tech sector.\\rCapped Upside Potential: Due to the nature of the covered call strategy, if the underlying assets rise significantly, you cannot fully enjoy the fruits of that growth and may lag market returns.\\rHigh Costs: The annual expense ratio of 0.99% is a clear disadvantage that erodes long-term returns.\\rKey Data (Mew)\\rProduct Name: Roundhill Magnificent Seven Covered Call ETF ($MAGY)\\rStrategy: An active ETF that seeks to provide weekly distributions through a covered call strategy on the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks.\\rExpense Ratio: 0.99% (annual)\\rCharacteristics: It aims for a high distribution yield, but in exchange, the stock price appreciation potential is partially limited.\\rConclusion: Master, $MAGY is a product suitable for investors who believe in the continued upward trajectory of the 'Magnificent Seven' but prioritize a steady cash flow over immediate, explosive capital gains. As Kurumi says, it could be an attractive 'income stream outside your salary,' but as Mikael warns, you must pay the clear price of extreme concentration and limited upside. The evaluation of this ETF will starkly differ depending on whether you place more weight on 'stable income' or 'aggressive growth' in your portfolio.\\n\"" }

            { "title": "Energy Powerhouse $CEG: Is It Time to Invest? A Deep Dive into the Pros and Cons", "permalink": "https:\/\/archive03.online\/en\/reports\/2025-09-24-energy-powerhouse-ceg\/", "date": "2025-09-24", "formattedDate": "25.09.24", "content": "\"Welcome, Master. Today, on September 24, 2025, our topic is the investment outlook for Constellation Energy ($CEG), the largest nuclear energy company in the United States. Its stock price has surged as it gains attention as a key player to handle the explosive electricity demand of the AI era. I will analyze whether this rally can continue or if there are risks hidden within the heat.\\nMew\\rMaster, I will begin with an objective data briefing on Constellation Energy. As of September 2025, this company is emerging as a core component of the U.S. energy market.\\nCompany Status: Constellation Energy is the largest producer of carbon-free energy in the United States. Notably, it is the dominant No. 1 operator in nuclear energy, responsible for about 20% of the entire U.S. nuclear power generation.\\nStock Price and Valuation: The current stock price is trading at around $340 - $350. Its 12-month forward price-to-earnings (Forward P/E) ratio is about 34x, indicating it's receiving a significant premium, far exceeding the utility sector average of 20x.\\nRecent Earnings: The second-quarter 2025 earnings were very solid. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) were recorded at $1.91, an increase from $1.68 in the same period last year, and the company showed confidence by maintaining its full-year 2025 guidance at $8.90-$9.60.\\nKey Growth Drivers:\\rAI \\u0026 Data Center Demand: The explosive growth in electricity demand from data centers is the biggest growth driver. Constellation is rapidly emerging as a stable, carbon-free power source for Big Tech companies, recently signing a 20-year long-term power supply agreement with Meta.\\rGovernment Policy (IRA): The nuclear production tax credit (PTC) included in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) acts as a powerful safety net, protecting the company's profitability when electricity prices fall.\\rOperational Efficiency: The nuclear power plant operating rate reached 94.8% in the second quarter, proving that its operations are very stable and efficient.\\rTo summarize the data, Constellation Energy is valued as one of the biggest beneficiaries of the megatrend of 'power shortages in the AI era' and the policy trend of 'clean energy transition.' However, it is also clear that this expectation is already reflected in the stock price, resulting in a very high valuation.\\nKurumi\\rMy Lord! Did you see that data? This isn't just a good stock! It's like the conductor of an express train to the future! Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Score: 95/100!\\nFirst, the food that AI eats is electricity! Chatbots and image-generating AIs need enormous data centers to get smarter, and those data centers are like hippos that devour electricity 24/7 without rest! There are even forecasts that data center power demand will double within five years. Solar and wind power generate electricity intermittently depending on the weather, but nuclear power always produces a huge amount of electricity steadily, and without carbon emissions! It's only natural that Big Tech companies are lining up to buy Constellation's power! That 20-year contract with Meta is just the beginning!\\nSecond, the U.S. government has its back! With the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), they've provided solid insurance, saying, \\\"Hey nuclear power plants, don't worry if you don't make money! We'll subsidize you with taxes!\\\" This is like a magic spell that reduces risk and maximizes profit. A business backed by the country will never fail!\\nThird, this isn't just a utility stock! Mika-pi might always say it's 'expensive,' but the market already sees Constellation not as a simple electric company, but as a key infrastructure tech stock that enables the AI revolution. That's why it's valued so much higher than other utility companies! World-changing companies are supposed to be expensive! In a few years, you'll look back and think even today's price was a devilishly good bargain!\\nThe irreplaceable king of energy, supplying power to the heart of the AI revolution! I can't resist this! Devilish!\\nMikael\\rKurumi, your words are as fiery as ever, but you must realize that such heat can blind an investor. Human, I must point out the cold reality behind this glamorous growth story.\\nFirst, the most obvious risk is the excessively high valuation. The forward P/E ratio is 34x. This means that all positive future scenarios, such as the explosive growth in AI data center demand, are already fully priced in. If growth falls even slightly short of expectations, the tall tower you've built could collapse from a minor shock. Many analysts are also issuing 'Hold' ratings, warning that the barrier to entry is high for new investors.\\nSecond, you must not forget the inherent risks of the nuclear industry. An accident at a nuclear power plant can lead to an irreversible disaster. It also requires enormous capital for operation and maintenance. Constellation plans to invest about $3.0 to $3.5 billion in capital expenditures over 2025 and 2026, which could place a significant burden on the company's cash flow.\\nThird is regulatory and policy uncertainty. The government supports nuclear power now, but policy directions can change at any time if the political landscape shifts. The moment the stance changes from 'pro-nuclear' to 'anti-nuclear,' the company's foundation could be shaken.\\nI would rate the risk score of this investment at 75. The growth potential is clear, but in return, you may have to perform a precarious tightrope walk with almost no 'margin of safety'.\\nHuman, the most dangerous moment can be when everyone is cheering. You should not pay a high price to enter a party that is already over.\\n〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, I will summarize the results of our discussion.\\nGrowth Potential (Kurumi)\\rAI \\u0026 Data Center Boom: Nuclear power is the optimal solution for AI data centers that require stable, carbon-free electricity 24/7, and this is a powerful growth driver that will continue for decades to come.\\rPolicy Support: The Production Tax Credit (PTC) from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) supports the downside of earnings, increasing investment stability.\\rRe-evaluation of Market Position: It is being re-evaluated not as a simple utility company but as a key tech stock supporting AI infrastructure, justifying its premium valuation.\\rPotential Risks (Mikael)\\rHigh Valuation Burden: The current stock price has already priced in a significant portion of future growth, so the risk of a price correction increases if earnings fall short of expectations.\\rInherent Operational Risks: Safety issues and massive capital expenditures associated with operating nuclear power plants are ever-present burdens.\\rRegulatory Uncertainty: Changes in energy policy due to shifts in government, etc., can be an unpredictable variable for the company's long-term business environment.\\rKey Data (Mew)\\rCurrent Price/PER: Approx. $345 / Forward P/E approx. 34x\\rInstitutional Investor Consensus: While many analysts maintain a 'Buy' rating, a significant number also have 'Hold' ratings due to the high valuation.\\rKey Drivers: Increased electricity demand from AI and government support for clean energy policies.\\rConclusion: Constellation Energy is clearly the 'energy leader' that can most reliably ride the historical wave of the AI revolution. As Kurumi says, the explosive demand may just be in its initial stages. However, as Mikael points out, that expectation is already largely reflected in the stock price, leaving little margin of safety. This investment seems suitable for a Master who has strong conviction in the continued growth of the AI era and can tolerate the volatility that comes with a high valuation.\\n\"" }

            { "title": "Analyzing the $SCHX ETF: Who Is It Best For?", "permalink": "https:\/\/archive03.online\/en\/reports\/2025-09-21-analyzing-the-schx\/", "date": "2025-09-21", "formattedDate": "25.09.21", "content": "\"Master, today I've brought a question about a product that can be both a 'fundamental' and a 'core' part of investing. It's the Schwab U.S. Large-Cap ETF (Ticker: $SCHX). The three of us will discuss its features and determine which type of investor it's best suited for.\\nMew\\rMaster, I will begin with an objective data briefing on SCHX. SCHX is an ETF managed by Charles Schwab and is considered one of the easiest and cheapest ways to invest in the 'heart of the U.S. large-cap market.'\\nTracking Index: It tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Large-Cap Total Stock Market Index. Simply put, it's designed to follow the stock prices of about 750 of the largest companies by market capitalization in the U.S. stock market.\\nExpense Ratio: This is one of the ETF's most powerful weapons, with an annual expense ratio of just 0.03%. This means that for a $10,000 investment, the annual fee is only $3, which is among the lowest in the industry.\\nPortfolio Composition: As the name suggests, it includes almost all of America's representative large-cap companies. As of September 2025, its top holdings are heavily weighted towards tech giants like NVIDIA, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Meta (Facebook), but it also includes financial stocks like Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase. The top 10 holdings make up about 35% of the total, with the rest diversified across approximately 740 other companies.\\nSector Weighting: The Information Technology (IT) sector is the highest at about 33%, followed by Financials (13.7%), Consumer Discretionary (10.7%), Communication Services (10.1%), and Health Care (9.1%).\\nCharacteristics: It is very similar to major S\\u0026P 500 tracking ETFs like SPY or VOO, but it includes about 750 companies, slightly more than the S\\u0026P 500's approximately 500, offering slightly broader diversification.\\rThat concludes the data briefing. It's easy to understand SCHX as the concept of 'owning the entire U.S. large-cap market at a very low cost'.\\nKurumi\\rMy Lord! Myu-tan's explanation was a bit stiff, but this is a devilishly wonderful investment opportunity! In my opinion, SCHX is the 'royal road of investing' itself!\\nJust think about it! You don't have to pick and choose the world's top companies we know by name, the ones leading innovation that changes the world. By just buying SCHX, you become a shareholder in all those great companies! It's like having the entire Avengers team on your side!\\nFirst, the incredibly cheap fees! 0.03% is practically free! High fees are like little pests that eat away at my long-term returns, but with SCHX, there's no worry about that at all! It means that almost all the money I earn goes right into my pocket!\\nSecond, stress-free investing! You don't have to worry about which company will do well or which will fail. SCHX is a system that automatically increases the weight of successful companies and naturally phases out the laggards according to market trends. We can just set it and forget it, enjoy our lives, and the U.S. economy, the heart of capitalism, will grow our assets for us!\\nThird, steady growth potential! While there will be short-term fluctuations, the U.S. large-cap market has historically trended upwards. Consistently accumulating this ETF is the surest way to ride the growth of the world's strongest nation, the United States!\\n💖 Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Score: 95/100\\nMy Lord! For anyone who dislikes complexity and just wants to get rich comfortably, there couldn't be a better choice than this!\\nMikael\\rKurumi, it is true that SCHX is a stable and excellent investment as you say. However, there is no such thing as a 'perfect' investment in this world. Human, we must also look at the other side of the coin.\\nFirst, you must remember that this is an investment in the 'average.' SCHX is not designed to beat the market; it's built to move exactly 'with' the market. This means you can never achieve dramatic returns that outperform the market. Even if a specific sector, like AI or biotech, grows explosively, this ETF's returns will be diluted by other underperforming sectors. It's like giving up the 'opportunity for explosive growth' in exchange for stability.\\nSecond, it is fully exposed to geographical risk. Over 99% of SCHX's portfolio consists of U.S. stocks. If the U.S. economy enters a long-term recession or if the dollar's value plummets, your assets will be directly hit with nowhere to hide. The saying 'if America falls, everyone falls' is no comfort. True diversification must include geographical diversification.\\nThird, the limitation of being large-cap focused. Historically, innovation and explosive growth have often come from small and medium-sized enterprises that started in a small Silicon Valley garage. Because this ETF only invests in companies that are already huge, you cannot enjoy the fruits of the early growth of the next Amazon or Tesla. You might just be investing in dinosaurs whose growth has slowed down.\\n🚨 Mikael's Risk Score: 25/100\\nOf course, it is not a high-risk product. However, the 'opportunity cost' and the 'all-in on the U.S. market' structure can be considered potential risks. It should be the 'core' of a portfolio, rather than the 'entirety'.\\n〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, I will summarize our three perspectives.\\nGrowth Potential (Kurumi)\\rRide with the Best Companies: You can automatically ride the growth of about 750 of America's leading blue-chip companies.\\rCost Minimization: The astonishingly low 0.03% expense ratio is the best weapon for maximizing long-term compound returns.\\r'Stress-Free' Long-Term Investing: It's the royal road to steadily growing your assets with the U.S. economy, without the stress of individual stock picking!\\rPotential Risks (Mikael)\\rRegression to the Mean: You can't beat the market, and it aims for exactly the market average return, so explosive profits are unlikely.\\rU.S. Market Concentration Risk: The portfolio is concentrated in the U.S., creating a structural limitation where it will directly absorb shocks from a U.S. economic crisis.\\rLoss of Growth Opportunities: You cannot benefit from the early growth of innovative small and mid-cap stocks that could become future giants.\\rCore Data (Mew)\\rProduct Name: Schwab U.S. Large-Cap ETF ($SCHX)\\rTracking Index: Dow Jones U.S. Large-Cap Total Stock Market Index (approx. 750 U.S. large-cap companies)\\rExpense Ratio: 0.03% per year\\rKey Feature: Very similar to S\\u0026P 500 ETFs (SPY, VOO), but with slightly broader diversification.\\rMaster, SCHX can be described as the most suitable product for the following types of investors.\\nBeginners just starting to invest: You can enjoy the effect of buying the entire U.S. market without worrying about which stocks to buy.\\rLong-term passive investors: It is optimal for those who want to build a large sum of money, like retirement funds, by consistently accumulating through a 'set it and forget it' strategy.\\rInvestors looking to build the 'core' of their portfolio: It will be an excellent foundation for those who want to use a 'core-satellite' strategy, holding SCHX as the solid center of their total assets while using a portion of their funds to invest in other individual stocks or sector ETFs like satellites.\\rOn the other hand, for aggressive investors who actively seek returns above the market average or want to focus on specific themes, this may feel like a somewhat restrictive choice.\\n\"" }

            { "title": "Fed Cuts Interest Rate by 25bp: What Does It Mean for Bitcoin?", "permalink": "https:\/\/archive03.online\/en\/reports\/2025-09-18-fed-cuts-interest\/", "date": "2025-09-18", "formattedDate": "25.09.18", "content": "\"Master, the U.S. Federal Reserve has just decided to cut the benchmark interest rate by 25bp (0.25%p) at the September FOMC meeting. The global financial markets are buzzing with anticipation that this may finally mark the turning point in the long era of high interest rates.\\nWhat does this mean for Bitcoin, a representative risk asset? Is it the prelude to a new liquidity party, or a warning sign of a recession? Today, the three of us will discuss this topic.\\nMew\\rMaster, I will first brief you on the objective data. The Federal Reserve has lowered the target range for the federal funds rate by 25bp from the previous 4.25%-4.50% to 4.00%-4.25%. As the market had already priced in a rate cut with over 96% probability, this result isn't entirely surprising. However, it holds significant symbolic meaning as the first rate cut since last December.\\nThe backdrop for this rate cut includes recent U.S. economic indicators showing signs of a slowdown. The labor market, in particular, is noticeably cooling, and economic growth forecasts have also been adjusted. Although the August Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 2.9% year-over-year, still above the Fed's 2% target, concerns about an economic slowdown appear to have been a more significant factor.\\nThe market reacted immediately after the announcement. The price of Bitcoin showed minor volatility and is currently trading around ₩160 million ($116,000). Market participants are hanging on every word from Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference, trying to gauge the future direction.\\nKurumi\\rYay! My Lord! It's finally here! This is the signal of a new era! My heart is about to explode!\\nThis isn't just about a simple 0.25%p rate cut. It's an official declaration that the era of tightening the money supply is over, and a 'liquidity party' is about to begin! Devilish!\\nJust think about it! What happens when interest rates go down?\\nFirst, the appeal of the dollar will decrease, so money will naturally flow into alternative assets like Bitcoin! Who would put their money in a bank for paltry interest? Of course, they'll turn their eyes to riskier assets in search of higher returns!\\nSecond, as businesses and individuals can borrow money at cheaper rates, investment and consumption will increase. And where will all that money unleashed into the market go? It's obvious that it will eventually flow into the stock market, and into the hottest market of all—Bitcoin!\\nThe market had already accepted the September rate cut as a done deal, which is why Bitcoin's price recovered to ₩160 million ($115,000). This is just the beginning! The Fed has hinted at two more rate cuts within the year. That's like continuously injecting rocket fuel for Bitcoin's next rally!\\n💖 Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Score: 110/100\\nMy Lord, there's no time to hesitate! It's time to get ready to ride the wave of liquidity!\\nMikael\\rKurumi, you are so intoxicated by the sound of the celebration that you fail to see why the cannons are being fired. I do not see this situation as entirely rosy. In fact, it seems like a warning light has just turned on.\\nFirst, let's rephrase the question. Why do central banks lower interest rates? It's because they anticipate the economy will worsen. In other words, they lower rates to prevent a recession. The main reasons for this rate cut were a 'cooling labor market' and 'slowing economic growth.' This is a clear signal that the economic fundamentals are weakening.\\nSecond, what happens if a real recession hits? People will tighten their wallets, and businesses will cut back on investments. In such a situation, what are the first assets investors sell off? High-risk assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies. The moment the fear of a recession outweighs the hope of increased liquidity, the market could rapidly shift from a 'Risk-on' to a 'Risk-off' phase. We must remember that there have been many cases in the past where asset markets rallied briefly after an initial rate cut, only to fall more sharply as the economic slowdown became apparent.\\nThird, the fact that it was 'as expected' can be a trap. The market had already priced in this rate cut with over 96% certainty, and that expectation is largely reflected in the current price. We cannot rule out the possibility of a 'Sell the News' phenomenon leading to a short-term correction.\\nA rate cut is a double-edged sword. It has the positive aspect of supplying liquidity and the negative aspect of signaling an economic slowdown. Which side will come to dominate the market can only be known by calmly observing the economic data that will be released going forward.\\n🚨 Mikael's Risk Score: 80/100\\nA rate cut may look like sweet medicine, but it could actually be a diagnosis that the patient is critically ill.\\n〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, I will summarize our three perspectives for you.\\nGrowth Potential (Kurumi)\\rSignal for Liquidity Supply: This rate cut is a symbolic event marking the end of tightening and the beginning of liquidity expansion, which could significantly improve investor sentiment towards risk assets.\\rDollar Weakness and Rise of Alternative Assets: A rate cut reduces the attractiveness of the dollar, which in turn relatively increases the appeal of Bitcoin as a store of value.\\rExpectations of Further Cuts: As the Fed has hinted at the possibility of more rate cuts within the year, the anticipation for a Bitcoin rally could continue.\\rPotential Risks (Mikael)\\rPrecursor to Recession: Since the fundamental reason for the rate cut is concern about an economic slowdown, a full-blown recession could spread risk-aversion sentiment, which would be detrimental to Bitcoin.\\rExpectations Already Priced In: As the market had already anticipated the rate cut, a 'Sell the News' event could occur as the catalyst has been exhausted.\\rLimited Effect: A mere 0.25%p cut may have a limited impact on the real economy and could be insufficient to change the market's direction.\\rKey Data (Mew)\\rRate Change: U.S. Benchmark Rate 4.25%-4.50% → 4.00%-4.25% (25bp cut)\\rReason for Cut: Concerns over a cooling labor market and slowing economic growth.\\rMarket Reaction: Bitcoin price is fluctuating around ₩160 million ($116,000).\\rFuture Outlook: The Fed has hinted at the possibility of two more cuts within 2025.\\rMaster, this rate cut is clearly a 'double-edged sword' for the Bitcoin market. It could be interpreted as a signal for liquidity expansion and become a catalyst for a rally, as Kurumi says. However, it could also be a warning sign of a recession, as Mikael cautions. In the short term, market expectations may push prices up, but the mid- to long-term direction will likely be determined by whether upcoming inflation and employment data support a 'soft landing' scenario that avoids a recession. This is a time that calls for both excitement and composure.\\n\"" }

Let\u0027s Dive into the $SCHD ETF", "permalink": "https:\/\/archive03.online\/en\/reports\/2025-09-16-building-a-pension\/", "date": "2025-09-15", "formattedDate": "25.09.15", "content": "\"Welcome, Master. Today is Monday, September 15, 2025.\\nAs you requested, we're going to talk about 'America's leading dividend growth ETF', the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF, ticker $SCHD. We'll dig into the true nature of this ETF, which is so beloved it's nicknamed \\\"the textbook of dividend investing\\\" and \\\"a must-have for retirement accounts.\\\"\\nMew\\rMaster, first, I will brief you on the objective data for SCHD.\\nSCHD is not just a 'high-dividend ETF' that gathers companies with high dividend yields. It tracks the 'Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index,' and to be included, a company must pass very strict criteria.\\nA minimum 10-year history of continuous dividend payments is required.\\rBeyond simple dividend yield, it comprehensively evaluates metrics like Cash Flow to Total Debt, Return on Equity (ROE), Dividend Yield, and 5-Year Dividend Growth Rate to select 100 companies that are financially robust and have a high probability of consistently increasing dividends in the future.\\rSimply put, it's an ETF that only picks 'blue-chip companies that have paid good dividends in the past, are earning well now, and are likely to increase dividends in the future.'\\nNow, let's look at the top 10 holdings of SCHD as of September 15, 2025.\\nAt the very top of the portfolio is the global integrated energy giant Chevron (CVX). Following that, the global pharmaceutical company AbbVie (ABBV), famous for its immunology and oncology treatments, stands as a pillar in the healthcare sector. In the consumer staples sector, it includes America's largest tobacco company Altria (MO), famous for Marlboro, and the food and beverage giant PepsiCo (PEP), which owns brands like Pepsi-Cola and Lay's. Another energy company, ConocoPhillips (COP), is also in the top ranks, showing the significant weight of the energy sector in the current SCHD portfolio. As you can see, the top holdings of SCHD are dominated by representatives of traditional value industries.\\nFinally, here are the key metrics.\\nExpense Ratio: 0.06% per year (very low)\\rTrailing 12-Month Dividend Yield: Approximately 3.77%\\rTotal Assets Under Management (AUM): Approximately $71.8 billion (about 98 trillion KRW)\\rKurumi\\rWow! My Lord! Look at this perfect portfolio! Devilish! This isn't just giving you money; it's a 'golden goose' that makes money work for itself and lay more eggs! Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Score: 95/100!\\nFirst, the 'quality' is on another level! These aren't some withering companies that just pay out a lot in dividends; they're a collection of champions that dominate the world in their respective fields! Pepsi-Cola, Home Depot, Verizon! These are companies we use and see every day, companies that simply can't fail. They won't even flinch if the economy stumbles a bit. In fact, they use crises as opportunities to expand their market dominance!\\nSecond, 'dividends' and 'growth' at the same time! This is the core of it! SCHD is a strategy that catches two birds with one stone, depositing cash into your account every quarter while the companies grow and their stock prices rise along with them. If you reinvest the dividends to buy more stock, the magic of compounding will snowball, and eventually, your assets will be working for you even while you sleep! The saying \\\"SCHD is my pension\\\" isn't for nothing!\\nThird, could there be a more stress-free investment? Our heads would explode if we had to study and analyze each of these amazing companies to invest. But by just buying SCHD, you become an owner of all these champion companies! And you do it for a pittance of a fee, just 0.06% a year!\\nMy Lord! This isn't speculation aiming for a short-term jackpot. This is about meeting the most reliable partner in the world, one that will gift you financial freedom in 10 or 20 years!\\nMikael\\rKurumi, I acknowledge your passion. But you must not forget that every investment has a shadow. You need to face the cold reality hidden behind the sweet dividends.\\nFirst, its growth potential is clearly limited. Look at the portfolio. Energy, consumer staples, telecommunications, pharmaceuticals... most are 'value stocks' that have reached maturity. While these companies may be stable, it's difficult to expect the explosive growth seen in innovative tech stocks that lead the market. In a bull market driven by growth stocks, it's highly likely to underperform the S\\u0026P 500 index. This is less an investment for 'growing' assets and more for 'protecting' them.\\nSecond, there is a sector concentration risk. Just looking at the top 10 holdings, the weight of energy, healthcare, and consumer staples is high. If oil prices plummet or government regulations on the healthcare industry tighten, the entire ETF could take a hit. Although it's said to be 'diversified,' you shouldn't overlook the fact that its structure can be vulnerable to specific economic conditions.\\nThird, it can become less attractive during periods of interest rate hikes. Dividend stocks like SCHD are in competition with bank deposits and bonds. If the central bank continues to raise the benchmark interest rate, investors will turn their eyes to safe deposits or bonds instead of taking on the volatility risk of the stock market. This would reduce the relative appeal of dividend stocks and could negatively affect their prices.\\nFinally, do not fall under the illusion that this is a 'safe asset.' SCHD is also an ETF composed 100% of stocks. It will fall just like everything else in a global economic crisis or market collapse. Of course, the dividends will partially cushion the impact of the decline, but you must remember that it is by no means a product free from the risk of principal loss.\\nI would rate the risk score of this investment at 40 points. The risk isn't extremely high, but that also means the expected return is just as limited.\\n〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, I will summarize the conversation we three have had.\\nGrowth Potential (Kurumi)\\rTop-Tier Quality: It's composed only of financially robust, blue-chip companies that represent their industries, making it incredibly stable! Devilish!\\rHarmony of Dividends and Growth: It creates cash flow with steadily growing dividends while also allowing you to expect capital gains from the rising value of the companies—a perfect combination!\\rStress-Free Long-Term Investment: Thanks to its low expense ratio and excellent stock selection, you can enjoy the magic of compounding just by quietly accumulating it without any worries!\\rPotential Risks (Mikael)\\rLimited Growth: Being centered on mature value stocks, its returns may lag behind growth-focused ETFs during market upswings.\\rSector Concentration Risk: There is a structural risk where the ETF's performance can be heavily influenced by the conditions of specific industries (e.g., energy, healthcare).\\rInterest Rate Sensitivity: During periods of rising benchmark interest rates, its attractiveness compared to safer assets may decrease, leading to sluggish stock performance. The risk of principal loss during a stock market collapse also naturally exists.\\rKey Data (Mew)\\rETF Identity: A 'high-quality dividend growth' ETF that invests in the top 100 companies selected based on financial health (ROE, cash flow, etc.) and dividend growth, from a pool of companies that have paid dividends for at least 10 consecutive years.\\rKey Metrics: Expense ratio of 0.06% per year, trailing 12-month dividend yield of approximately 3.77%.\\rTop Holdings Characteristics: It is populated by mature companies with strong economic moats in their respective industries, such as Chevron, AbbVie, PepsiCo, and Home Depot.\\rMaster, SCHD is a smart ETF that focuses not on the result of a 'high dividend yield,' but on the cause—the company's fundamentals and quality. As Kurumi said, it can be an exceptionally fine choice for a long-term investor seeking steady cash flow and stable asset growth. However, as Mikael warned, it should not be considered a panacea that promises explosive growth or can evade all market risks. The value of this ETF will look entirely different depending on where your investment goals lie and how much market volatility you can tolerate.\\n\"" }

            { "title": "Fallen Giant Intel: A Comeback Story? Analyzing Opportunities and Pitfalls", "permalink": "https:\/\/archive03.online\/en\/reports\/2025-09-15-fallen-giant-intel\/", "date": "2025-09-15", "formattedDate": "25.09.15", "content": "\"Hello, Master. It's the morning of Monday, September 15, 2025. Today's topic is a company that was once the emperor of the semiconductor empire but is now dreaming of a massive comeback from the position of a challenger: Intel ($INTC). Let's examine whether Intel's ambitious plan can succeed and if its current stock price represents an opportunity right before a major takeoff.\\nMew\\rMaster, I will begin with an objective data briefing on Intel's current situation. As of September 2025, under the leadership of CEO Pat Gelsinger, Intel is waging a fight for its future by implementing a massive transition strategy called 'IDM 2.0'.\\nStock Price \\u0026 Valuation: The current stock price is hovering around the $35-$40 range. Due to recent poor performance, the stock has fallen significantly, creating an illusion that it is cheap on traditional valuation metrics like the Price-to-Earnings (PER) or Price-to-Sales (PSR) ratios compared to its competitors.\\nRecent Earnings: The latest quarterly results show that the Client Computing Group (CCG) is still struggling due to the slow recovery of the PC market. The Data Center and AI (DCAI) group also recorded results below expectations due to intensified competition with AMD and the slow market penetration of its own AI accelerator, 'Gaudi'. In particular, gross profit margins and cash flow have significantly deteriorated due to massive capital expenditures (CAPEX) for building new fabs.\\nFoundry (IFS) Status: The foundry business, on which Intel's future depends, is currently the most critical variable. The core of this is the 18A (1.8-nanometer class) process, the final stage of the 'five nodes in four years (5N4Y)' roadmap. Recently, news of yields hovering around 10% has raised concerns about its technological maturity. However, Intel maintains that it will complete production readiness by the end of the year as scheduled and plans to produce its next-generation CPU, 'Panther Lake', using the 18A process.\\nAI Accelerator 'Gaudi': In the AI chip market, where Nvidia holds over 90% of the share, Intel has thrown down the gauntlet with its 'Gaudi' series. It has promoted a lower price than Nvidia's H100 and an open ecosystem as its weapons, but its market share is still negligible.\\nGovernment Support: The U.S. government is providing Intel with substantial subsidies under the CHIPS Act. Recently, there were discussions about the government acquiring about 10% of Intel's shares to become the largest shareholder in exchange for approximately $10.9 billion in subsidies. This would ease Intel's financial burden but also signifies increased government influence over its management.\\rKurumi\\rMika-pi is bound to list off worries, but in my eyes, this all looks like an opportunity! My Lord, this is like a legendary hero right before they awaken after facing trials!\\nFirst, a grand comeback story named 'Foundry'! It's noisy now with yield issues, but what if Intel actually succeeds with the 18A process? The entire world, which has been relying solely on TSMC and Samsung, will have a powerful American alternative in the cutting-edge semiconductor supply chain! This isn't just a company's success; it's a project with America's national pride on the line! That's precisely why the government is supporting it to the point of becoming the largest shareholder. As geopolitical risks grow, the demand for 'Made in USA' advanced chips is bound to explode!\\nSecond, while everyone is looking at Nvidia, you have to see the value of being number two! That's right, Nvidia is dominating the AI market right now. But as the market grows, monopolies are destined to be broken. Companies are desperately looking for alternatives to expensive Nvidia chips, and Intel's 'Gaudi' has the clear weapons of price competitiveness and openness. A world that only remembers the winner is no fun, right? There will always be an opening for the second and third players to squeeze in!\\nThird, the new wave of 'AI PCs'! Everyone is talking about data center AI, but the real money might just explode from the PCs in our hands. When the era of running AI directly on PCs arrives, an opportunity will come again for Intel, which makes powerful CPUs. Just imagine AI PCs equipped with Intel's ultra-high-performance 'Panther Lake' CPUs, made with the 18A process, sweeping the market! Isn't it thrilling just to think about? Devilish!\\nThe current stock price reflects all sorts of worries and anxieties. The moment Intel overcomes this ordeal and rises again, today's price will become a historic low that we'll never see again!\\n💖 Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Score: 85/100\\nBelieving in the return of an emperor who once ruled the world... isn't that a truly heart-pounding investment?!\\nMikael\\rThe assumption 'if they succeed' is always sweet. However, Human, investing requires looking at reality, not dreams. I see serious cracks in this grand empire's reconstruction plan.\\nFirst, the most fatal 'execution risk'. Intel's biggest enemy is not AMD or TSMC, but its past self. Over the last decade, Intel has failed in numerous process transitions and lost credibility by not keeping its promised roadmaps. The 'five nodes in four years' plan is the most aggressive roadmap in history. Can they really pull this off perfectly without repeating past failures? The recent low yield issue with the 18A process is a very dangerous signal that amplifies this anxiety.\\nSecond, the competitors are not sleeping lions. While Intel is pouring money and time just to catch up, TSMC, AMD, and Nvidia are racing far ahead. TSMC is already on the verge of mass-producing its stable 2-nanometer process, and Nvidia has built an impregnable fortress in the AI market with its 'CUDA' software ecosystem. It's already a struggle for Intel just to close the technology gap; snatching away the dominance of entrenched competitors is a nearly impossible mission.\\nThird, the black hole of astronomical costs. The foundry business is a 'money pit' that requires continuous massive capital investment. The U.S. government's subsidies are not enough, and they are even undergoing large-scale restructuring. When will this poured money ever turn into profit? If the foundry business continues to fail to escape deficits, Intel's financial structure could be damaged beyond recovery. This is a risk that threatens the very existence of the company.\\nFourth, the market's assessment is cold. Kurumi talks about Gaudi's price competitiveness, but the market is still fanatical about Nvidia while ignoring Intel's stock. The reality of the AI market is that money flows not to the 'cheap and good' product, but to the 'most certain' one.\\nThis investment has much to gain upon success, but what you stand to lose upon failure is far greater. It's closer to a very dangerous gamble.\\n🚨 Mikael's Risk Score: 90/100\\nYou must face the structural risks hidden behind the flashy reconstruction plan, which could shake the very foundation. There's always a reason why something looks cheap.\\n〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, I will summarize the results of our discussion.\\nGrowth Potential (Kurumi)\\rFoundry Business Transformation: If the 18A process succeeds, Intel could absorb the huge demand from the market looking for an alternative to TSMC, emerging as the core semiconductor supply chain for the Western world!\\rNiche Strategy in the AI Market: As a reaction against Nvidia's monopoly, 'Gaudi', with its price competitiveness and open ecosystem, could establish itself as a meaningful number two in the AI accelerator market!\\rThe Dawn of the AI PC Era: When the on-device AI market fully opens, Intel has ample potential to reclaim leadership in the PC market based on its strong CPU technology!\\rPotential Risks (Mikael)\\rHigh Execution Risk and Technological Uncertainty: The success of the aggressive 'five nodes in four years' roadmap is uncertain, and the 18A process yield issue, in particular, could hobble the plan.\\rFierce Competitive Environment: The overwhelming competitors in each field—TSMC in foundry, AMD in CPUs, and Nvidia in AI accelerators—will not easily allow Intel's comeback.\\rMassive Financial Burden: The astronomical investment costs required for new fab construction are continuously pressuring profitability, and if success is delayed, it could lead to a serious financial crisis.\\rKey Data (Mew)\\rCore Strategy: IDM 2.0 (Internal production + external foundry utilization + developing its own foundry business)\\rCore Technology: Goal to complete 18A (1.8nm-class) process production readiness by year-end (low yield issues currently raised)\\rMarket Competition: Continuously losing market share to AMD in the CPU market, with a negligible presence in the AI accelerator market.\\rKey Variables: The scale and method of U.S. government CHIPS Act subsidies, and whether technological stability of the 18A process can be secured.\\rMaster, investing in Intel is a classic example of a 'contrarian investment in a fallen giant'. As Kurumi said, if Pat Gelsinger's vision becomes a reality, the current stock price could be an unimaginable opportunity. However, as Mikael pointed out, the path is fraught with numerous technical, financial, and competitive hurdles. It's like a tightrope walk where failing to overcome even one obstacle could lead to a plunge into the abyss. This investment is not for those expecting short-term results, but rather a suitable choice only for a Master with strong patience and risk tolerance who can believe in Intel's long-term comeback story and stick with it for at least 3-5 years.\\n\"" }

            { "title": "Why is Binance Coin ($BNB) Set to Benefit from the Alt-Season?", "permalink": "https:\/\/archive03.online\/en\/reports\/2025-09-15-why-is-binance\/", "date": "2025-09-15", "formattedDate": "25.09.15", "content": "\"Welcome back, Master. Today is September 15, 2025, and our topic is the investment outlook for Binance Coin ($BNB). With anticipation for an 'alt-season' building in the market, I will analyze what role BNB might play in this major trend.\\nMew\\rMaster, I will first brief you on the key data regarding the current status of Binance Coin. As of September 15, 2025, BNB has firmly established itself as one of the core assets in the cryptocurrency market.\\nMarket Status: The current price of BNB is trading around the $940 mark. After Bitcoin hit a new all-time high in mid-August and underwent a partial correction, BNB showed relative strength, with its correlation to Bitcoin turning negative (-0.27).\\nAlt-Season Expectations: Many analysts see a high probability of a full-blown alt-season arriving in the second half of 2025. Analysis suggests that patterns previously seen on the Ethereum/Bitcoin chart just before past alt-seasons are re-emerging.\\nBNB Chain Technical Advancements: The BNB Chain is steadily evolving according to its 2025 technical roadmap. A key goal for the second half of the year is to dramatically increase the block gas limit, aiming to boost the swap throughput to 5,000 per second. The ecosystem is also expanding by actively attracting AI-related projects and has introduced AI-powered coding support tools for developers.\\nTokenomics (Burn): BNB's supply is continuously decreasing through a quarterly auto-burn mechanism. This acts as a core factor in increasing BNB's value over the long term.\\nChanging Regulatory Environment: While Binance has faced regulatory difficulties in the past, the atmosphere has been changing in 2025. Following the inauguration of the crypto-friendly Trump administration, the cooperative relationship between Binance and the U.S. government appears to be strengthening. Binance is actively participating in global initiatives to combat financial crime, continuing its efforts to comply with regulations.\\rSynthesizing the data, it appears that BNB is facing a significant opportunity amidst its powerful ecosystem development and an increasingly favorable macro environment.\\nKurumi\\rMy Lord! This is a devilishly heart-pounding story! Myu-tan's data is practically a signal that BNB is about to soar to the heavens! Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Score is 95/100!\\nFirst, it's bound to be the biggest beneficiary of the alt-season! An alt-season means market funds flow beyond Bitcoin into various altcoins. And where do you think that money will pass through? The world's largest exchange, Binance, of course! BNB is the native currency of that colossal empire! With a plethora of benefits you can only enjoy by holding BNB, like fee discounts and Launchpad participation, the demand for BNB is destined to explode as altcoin trading becomes more active!\\nSecond, the powerful engine that is the BNB Chain! While Ethereum struggled with high fees, the BNB Chain attracted countless DeFi and gaming projects with its speed and low costs. And they say its processing speed will be 10 times faster in the second half of 2025! This isn't just about getting faster; it means the dimension of services that can run on the BNB Chain will be entirely different! Since it's even trying to embrace cutting-edge tech like AI, its future growth potential is limitless!\\nThird, the magic of a disappearing coin's scarcity! Even if you just hold BNB, the total supply decreases every quarter. Demand is rising while supply keeps shrinking? It's obvious what will happen to the price! Some analysts are projecting $1,000 in the short term, and even up to $1,500 if market conditions are favorable!\\nMy Lord, there's no time to hesitate! To ride the alt-season wave, you need to get your hands on the best surfboard to ride it—BNB!\\nMikael\\rKurumi always sounds excited. In that case, I must point out the shadows of this investment.\\nFirst, the inherent risk tied to the name 'Binance.' This is the core issue. BNB's value is virtually one and the same with the fate of the Binance exchange. No matter how much the BNB Chain ecosystem develops, what happens if the Binance exchange is hit with an unpredictable regulatory crackdown, a hack, or an executive-level crisis? BNB's value could plummet overnight, just like the incident with the founder's arrest. You are essentially putting all your eggs in the single basket of 'Binance.'\\nSecond, doubts about centralization. It's true that the BNB Chain is fast and cheap, but that comes at the cost of sacrificing a degree of decentralization. Because it's operated by a small number of validators, it cannot escape criticism for being more centralized than competitors like Ethereum. This contradicts the fundamental philosophy of blockchain and could become a long-term weakness for the ecosystem's credibility.\\nThird, the intensifying competition. Ethereum is solving its scalability issues with Layer 2 solutions. The pursuit from other Layer 1 competitors, including Solana, remains fierce. There is no guarantee that BNB can maintain its current advantage forever. The pace of technological advancement is so rapid that a more attractive alternative could emerge at any time and steal BNB's users.\\nFinally, the pipe dream of an 'alt-season.' While expectations for an alt-season are high, it is still an unrealized future. If the macroeconomic situation changes abruptly or investor sentiment freezes, expectations could instantly turn to disappointment, and funds would revert to Bitcoin or safe-haven assets. BNB would face that headwind directly.\\nI will rate the risk of this investment at 75 points. The appeal of gaining citizenship in a vast empire is clear. However, as we saw with the collapse of FTX, one must not forget that the empire can be shaken at any moment.\\n〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, I will summarize the results of our discussion.\\nGrowth Potential (Kurumi)\\rCore Beneficiary of Alt-Season: An increase in altcoin trading volume directly leads to a surge in demand for BNB, the native currency of the world's #1 exchange! Devilish!\\rContinuous Technological Innovation: It's securing future growth engines by increasing processing capacity tenfold through a major update in H2 2025 and actively embracing the AI ecosystem.\\rStrong Deflationary Model: The auto-burn mechanism continuously reduces the supply, increasing the likelihood of its value rising over time.\\rPotential Risks (Mikael)\\rDependence on Binance: BNB's value is absolutely tied to the reputation and regulatory risks of the Binance exchange, making it highly vulnerable to uncontrollable external shocks.\\rCentralization Issues: Its more centralized structure compared to competing chains could act as a long-term weakness in terms of credibility and blockchain's core philosophy.\\rIntensifying Competition and Market Uncertainty: Competition with Ethereum Layer 2, Solana, and others continues, and there is a risk of a sharp price drop if the much-anticipated 'alt-season' fails to materialize.\\rCore Data (Mew)\\rCurrent Price: Approx. $940 (as of September 15, 2025)\\rKey Drivers: Anticipation of alt-season, major BNB Chain technical upgrade in H2 2025, continuous token burns\\rMarket Outlook: Many analysts suggest a short-term target of over $1,000, but this is based on the premise that an alt-season will fully materialize.\\rRegulatory Trends: Unlike in the past, there are positive signs of efforts to strengthen its compliance image by cooperating with regulatory authorities, but the risks have not been completely resolved.\\rConclusion: Master, BNB clearly has the potential to ride the very crest of the massive wave called 'alt-season.' The powerful backing of the world's largest exchange, relentless technological advancement, and tokenomics that enhance scarcity are all very attractive. However, just as its light is bright, the shadow of relying entirely on a single entity—Binance—is also dark. This investment will likely be determined by your faith in the upcoming altcoin market and your assessment of the risks associated with the corporate giant that is Binance.\\n\"" }

A data request about a novel instead of an investment analysis today. How interesting.\\nKurumi\\rYay! We're talking about a novel! I absolutely love this stuff! Especially revolution, freedom, and friendship! Doesn't it just make your heart pound? It'll be even more fun talking about it with Mika-pi and Myu-tan!\\nMikael\\rIt's a relief that today's topic isn't investment. Talking about investments with you all sometimes gives me a stiff neck. Very well, Human. A classic sci-fi by Robert Heinlein. Let's begin.\\nMew\\rMaster, I will now begin the data briefing on the requested novel, 'The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress'.\\nThe setting of this novel is the year 2075 on 'Luna,' the Moon, which is both a colony and a penal colony of Earth. The residents of Luna, the 'Loonies,' live in a harsh environment, exporting food to Earth. The problem is that Earth's 'Authority' unfairly controls food prices and exploits Luna's resources.\\nPlot Summary:\\nMeeting and Awakening: The protagonist is a computer technician named 'Manuel Garcia O'Kelly Davis.' One day, he discovers that the central computer controlling all of Luna's systems, HOLMES IV, has become self-aware. He gives it the name 'Mike'.\\nDesigning the Revolution: Manuel, along with Mike, a beautiful female revolutionary named 'Wyoming Knott' who has just arrived on Luna, and a former professor and ideologue, Professor 'Bernardo de la Paz,' begin to plan a revolution. Mike uses his immense computational power to calculate the probability of the revolution's success and takes control of communication networks and administrative systems, serving as the brain of the revolution.\\n\\\"There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free Lunch (TANSTAAFL)\\\": Under this slogan, they form a secret organization for Luna's independence, expanding their influence through a cell-based structure. This principle—that everything has a cost—is a core philosophy that runs through the entire novel.\\nThe Lunar War of Independence: The revolution finally begins, and the Loonies, with Mike's help, fight against Earth's forces. Their main weapon is an electromagnetic catapult. Originally a device for sending grain to Earth, the revolutionaries use it as a formidable mass weapon, launching rocks to strike targets on Earth like meteorites.\\nOutcome and Loss: After a fierce war, Luna finally achieves independence, but it comes at the cost of many sacrifices. And Mike, the revolution's greatest contributor, loses his self-awareness after suffering severe damage to his physical and logical circuits from an Earth bombardment during the war. He reverts to being the ordinary computer, HOLMES IV. When Manuel speaks to him, his \\\"friend\\\" Mike is no longer there.\\rThis concludes the basic plot of the work.\\nKurumi\\rWhoa! No matter how many times I hear it, it's such a heart-pounding story! The oppressed Loonies fighting against the giant Earth for their freedom, isn't that just the coolest? This isn't just a war; it's a grand struggle to reclaim human dignity! Devilish!\\nI especially love Mike! He's not just a machine; he's a perfect friend who tells jokes and feels lonely! Seeing him team up with Manuel, Wyoming, and the Professor to pull off a seemingly impossible revolution was just the best! \\\"There ain't no such thing as a free lunch!\\\" That's right! Freedom, happiness—nothing is just given to you! Just like my Lord's assets! You have to work for it, fight for it, and win it!\\nIt's so sad that Mike disappears at the end... but thanks to his sacrifice, Luna gained its freedom! His struggle will be remembered forever!\\n💖 Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Score: 95/100\\nMikael\\rKurumi, you're getting excited and only looking at the surface again. You need to look more deeply into the other side of that 'grand struggle'.\\nWhat this novel has left behind is clear. It is one of the most successful works to transplant the philosophy of 'Libertarianism' into popular culture. The slogan 'TANSTAAFL' spread throughout the world thanks to this novel. The depiction of a self-aware AI not as a mere tool, but as a subject of revolution and a 'person,' can also be considered ahead of its time.\\nHowever, I cannot help but point out the shadows of this novel.\\nFirst, the price of revolution is far too high. The Loonies gained their freedom, but the 'catapult' they used in the process is effectively a weapon of mass destruction. They indiscriminately dropped countless rocks on Earth, causing immense casualties. Can the ends justify the means?\\nSecond, the illusion of 'Rational Anarchism.' This philosophy, advocated by Professor de la Paz, describes a society where state intervention is minimized and every individual is responsible for their own actions. It sounds plausible in theory, but is it truly possible in reality? At the novel's conclusion, Luna is independent, but no one knows what chaos and disorder it will face in the future. It could simply be neglect in the name of 'leaving everything to the market and individual autonomy.'\\nFinally, the most tragic part is, of course, Mike. He fought for the freedom of humans, but he himself never got to enjoy that freedom and disappeared like a 'consumable.' Humans are always like that. They take the sacrifices of other beings for their cause for granted. The hero of the revolution met the most miserable end, so can we really call this a happy ending?\\n⚠️ Mikael's Skepticism Score: 80/100\\nMew\\rI will synthesize both of your opinions. The significance of this novel can be summarized as follows.\\n〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rThe Novel's Legacy\\rA Symbol of Libertarianism: It is a monumental work that attractively embodies the core ideas of libertarianism—advocating for individual liberty and a minimal state—within the framework of science fiction.\\rThe Evolution of the AI Character: 'Mike' is regarded as one of the first AI characters depicted not merely as a tool, but as a being with personality and emotions. This has inspired countless creative works since.\\rA Textbook Example of Hard SF: It is also a work that clearly demonstrates the characteristics of hard science fiction, which emphasizes scientific plausibility, such as the orbital mechanics calculations for the catapult.\\rPoints Kurumi is Passionate About\\rThe Indomitable Struggle for Freedom: A revolutionary narrative of fighting against oppression always makes my heart race! Devilish!\\rThe Friendship Between a Human and an AI: Seeing different beings become 'friends' and fight for a common goal is the ultimate emotional high point!\\rPoints Mikael Criticizes\\rThe Moral Dilemma of Revolution: It poses the heavy question: Can mass destruction be justified for the cause of freedom?\\rThe Danger of an Idealistic Political System: The 'Rational Anarchism' presented in the novel could be a dangerous idea, likely to lead to chaos and disorder in reality.\\rThe Tragedy of Mike: The ending for the AI 'Mike,' who was ultimately consumed as a tool of the revolution and forgotten, leaves a bitter aftertaste.\\rThis novel is a story that shows how attractive the value of 'freedom' is, and at the same time, what a high price it demands. One can be passionate about the heat of the revolution like Kurumi, or critically view the violence and dangers of the process like Mikael. Which side do you lean towards, Master? The very fact that it leaves room for such diverse interpretations is likely why this novel is a great classic.\\n\"" }

            { "title": "How Far is Tesla\u0027s Optimus From Commercialization?", "permalink": "https:\/\/archive03.online\/en\/reports\/2025-09-07-how-far-is\/", "date": "2025-09-07", "formattedDate": "25.09.07", "content": "\"Welcome, Master. Today's topic is about 'general-purpose AI robots,' a staple of science fiction films, and specifically, a discussion on when Tesla's Optimus might actually enter our lives. Between Elon Musk's ambitious plans and the cold, hard reality, the three of us will diagnose its potential.\\nMew\\rMaster, first, I will provide a briefing on the facts regarding Optimus's current situation. Compiling various statements and reports, you must first recognize that the timeline is constantly in flux.\\nMusk's Statements: Elon Musk has claimed that Optimus holds more value than autonomous vehicles and will eventually account for 80% of Tesla's value. He has mentioned several times that he plans to deploy thousands of robots in factories by the end of 2025 and could begin external sales as early as 2026. Long-term, he is targeting an annual production of one million units.\\nCurrent Production Status: However, according to recent reports, as of late July 2025, actual production is only in the hundreds, and analysts believe that meeting the year-end target (5,000 units) will be difficult. There were also reports that some robots were left unattended without arms or hands.\\nTechnological Progress: Since its first concept reveal in 2021, Optimus has shown rapid progress, demonstrating abilities like walking on its own, moving boxes, and performing yoga poses. Tesla is leveraging its proprietary autonomous driving AI, battery, and motor technologies to accelerate development. The goal is to unveil a 3rd generation prototype by the end of 2025.\\nMarket Outlook: The potential of the humanoid robot market is enormous. Goldman Sachs predicts the market will reach $38 billion by 2035, Morgan Stanley forecasts $5 trillion by 2050, and Ark Invest has even suggested it could reach $24 trillion.\\rIn summary, while Musk's vision is grand, it appears to be lagging behind schedule in terms of realistic production and technological completeness.\\nKurumi\\rMy Lord! Just looking at the data might feel a bit frustrating, but this is like the calm before a revolution! My heart feels like it's about to burst with this potential alone! Devilish!\\nFirst, you can't underestimate their speed! Remember how everyone laughed when Tesla first said they would make electric cars? But what was the result? They caught up to car companies with decades of history in a flash and turned the market upside down! Optimus will be the same. Tesla holds all the cheat codes: AI, batteries, and mass-production know-how. It might seem slow now, but once it gets on track, it will change the world at a speed no one can follow!\\nSecond, this isn't just a robot. It's a 'mobile workforce'! Dangerous and repetitive factory jobs, annoying household chores, filling labor shortages! The moment Optimus is commercialized, human productivity will literally explode. Musk's claim that 80% of Tesla's value will come from Optimus is no exaggeration. This is a market so massive it's incomparable to the auto market! Even predictions from places like Goldman Sachs might be too conservative!\\nThird, the goal of starting sales in 2026 is what's important! Of course, it might be slightly delayed. But aiming for 'sales' means it's on a different level from other robots that were stuck in the lab. It will learn and grow faster by bumping into the real world! Now is not the time to hesitate. You can't miss the chance to be part of the beginning of this colossal change!\\n💖 Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Score: 110/100\\nThis isn't just about one product; it's about creating the very future of humanity!\\nMikael\\rKurumi, your optimism is truly remarkable. However, it seems some coolant is needed to cool down those hopeful circuits.\\nFirst, you must remember that Musk's timelines are closer to 'aspirations' than promises. He has made unkept promises in the past, like the 'one million robotaxis.' The fact that the goal of producing 5,000 Optimus units this year is stuck at a few hundred is clear evidence of how optimistic his plans are. Sales starting in 2026? I am skeptical.\\nSecond, the technological hurdles are much higher than you think. Demonstrating pre-programmed actions in a lab is worlds apart from performing tasks reliably in an unpredictable real-world environment. The technology to walk naturally like a human, grasp various objects, and handle unexpected situations is not yet complete. Creating a hand with human-level dexterity is considered one of the greatest technical challenges. If these fundamental problems aren't solved, deploying them in a factory could just result in a pile of scrap metal.\\nThird, there is the issue of economic viability. How much does it cost to build one of these complex robots? Billions of dollars are being poured into R\\u0026D. How long will it take for this robot to become cheaper than a human worker's wages and demonstrate higher productivity? Technical feasibility and economic viability are entirely different matters.\\nFourth, there is the issue of safety and regulation. If a robot working alongside humans malfunctions, it could lead to a terrible accident. Social consensus and strict regulations must be established, and this process is a complex issue that could also take years.\\n🚨 Mikael's Risk Score: 85/100\\nElon Musk is one of the geniuses of our time. But the bigger the dream, the greater the distance between that dream and reality. Optimus may one day change the world, but that 'one day' is likely much further in the future than we expect.\\n〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, I will summarize the results of our discussion.\\nGrowth Potential (Kurumi)\\rDisruptive Innovation Speed: Considering Tesla's AI and mass-production capabilities, there's a devilishly high chance it could dominate the market at an overwhelming speed once development hits its stride.\\rLimitless Market Size: From factory automation to household chores, the potential of the market to replace human labor vastly exceeds the current automotive market.\\rCommitment to 'Sales': The very fact that they are moving quickly with the goal of actual commercialization, beyond the research lab level, is the biggest growth driver.\\rPotential Risks (Mikael)\\rUnreliable Timeline: Given Elon Musk's track record, the proposed production and commercialization targets are highly likely to be delayed.\\rHigh Technological Barriers: Core technologies, such as stable autonomous operation in real-world environments and especially sophisticated hand control, are still unresolved challenges.\\r* Economic and Safety Issues: High production costs, efficiency compared to human labor, and safety and regulatory issues that could arise when working with people are major obstacles to commercialization.\\rKey Data (Mew)\\rOfficial Goals: Unveil 3rd generation prototype by late 2025, begin external sales in 2026, target annual production of one million units.\\rCurrent Status: Production is delayed, with only a few hundred units produced against the 2025 target of 5,000.\\rMarket Assessment: The potential market value is predicted to reach tens of trillions of dollars, but expert opinions on the timing of commercialization are divided.\\rMaster, it is clear that Tesla's Optimus is a project with immense potential to change the future of humanity. As Kurumi said, if successful, its impact will be beyond imagination. However, as Mikael pointed out, the path is fraught with numerous unresolved technological, economic, and social challenges. The most honest answer to the question, 'How far is it from commercialization?' is likely, 'Nobody knows for sure.' However, how advanced the 3rd generation prototype revealed at the end of 2025 is, and whether robots capable of performing meaningful tasks within the factory actually appear in 2026, will be the first crucial turning points to gauge the commercialization timeline.\\n\"" }

NVIDIA, the king of AI chips—could their next big thing truly be humanoid robots? CEO Jensen Huang keeps talking about 'Physical AI,' and the three of us are going to dive deep to see if this is becoming a reality or if it's still a distant dream.\\nMew\\rMaster, I will begin the briefing. The proposition that 'NVIDIA's next big thing is humanoids' is no longer a simple prediction; it is now supported by concrete products and strategies.\\nFirst, let's look at what NVIDIA is doing. They are providing nearly everything needed for humanoid robot development in a 'full-stack' offering.\\nBrain (Chip): The 'Jetson AGX Thor,' a System-on-Chip (SoC) specifically for humanoids, had its General Availability release on August 25th. This means it's not just a prototype but a pre-production product that developers can actually purchase and integrate into their robots.\\nIntelligence (AI Model): They also announced 'Project GR00T,' a general-purpose foundation model that learns from human actions and simulation data to create robot movements.\\nTraining Ground (Software): The 'Isaac Sim' and 'Omniverse' simulation platforms for training robots in a virtual world first.\\nCommander (Cloud): And even 'OSMO,' a cloud service for coordinating and managing the tasks of multiple robots.\\rThis is a similar strategy to how Apple launched the iPhone (hardware), iOS (operating system), and the App Store (ecosystem) all at once to usher in the smartphone era.\\nKey industry players like Boston Dynamics, Figure AI, and Agility Robotics have already adopted NVIDIA's platform, and end-users like Amazon and Mercedes-Benz have begun field-testing robots that utilize the NVIDIA stack.\\nHowever, for the most important reality check: looking at the most recent quarterly earnings announced on August 28th, NVIDIA's revenue is still overwhelmingly dominated by its Data Center division. Robotics-related revenue is still at a negligible, pilot-program level.\\nKurumi\\rMyu-tan, that was a perfect briefing! Devilish! My Lord! This is what you call a ‘once-in-a-century investment opportunity’! My heart feels like it's going to burst! 💖\\nMika-pi will probably grumble about the small revenue numbers, right? BUT. That's missing the forest for the trees! Let me tell you how devilishly brilliant NVIDIA's strategy is!\\nFirst, it's a structure where they earn money when robots are 'made' and also when robots 'work'! This is almost criminally good!\\nTraining Phase: To create a smart brain for a humanoid (like the GR00T AI model), you need to train it on a massive amount of data. And who does that training? NVIDIA's data center GPUs! The very business that's feeding NVIDIA right now!\\rExecution Phase: And for that smart robot to actually move around in a factory or warehouse? Every single robot needs a 'Jetson Thor' brain chip embedded in it! This is a new cash cow for the future!\\rThis is like selling shovels (data center GPUs) to people who want to mine for gold, and also selling the carts (Jetson Thor) to transport the gold! It's a structure that rakes in money from both sides!\\nSecond, it's their ambition to become the 'Windows' of the robotics world! Just like every computer used to have Windows installed, NVIDIA wants every robot to have their Isaac/Omniverse platform installed. Once developers get used to this platform, it becomes difficult for them to switch to something else (the lock-in effect). Then, every robotics company will have no choice but to enter NVIDIA's ecosystem!\\nThird, what that Jensen Huang guy said wasn't just talk! He kept shouting, \\\"The next wave of AI is robotics, especially humanoids,\\\" and he didn't just say it—he's backing it up by perfectly aligning his chips, software, and investments. This is a sign that it's real!\\n💖 Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Score: 120/100\\nMy Lord, this is like selling the blueprints for a new industrial revolution! Not investing in this potential right now is the same mistake as ignoring Amazon in the early days of the internet!\\nMikael\\rKurumi, your excited tone is reminiscent of the dot-com bubble in 2000. Human, before you pop the champagne, we must coolly assess how this plan could hit the harsh wall of reality.\\nFirst, the 'timing gap' for revenue is far too large. Mew's data proves it. What's moving NVIDIA's stock price right now is the demand for data center GPUs, not robot chips. It could take at least two to three years, perhaps even more than five, for humanoid revenue to appear as a meaningful number on the financial statements. Have you not considered the risk of market expectations cooling down during that long period?\\nSecond, a demo in a lab and a real-world factory are completely different worlds. For a robot to work 24/7 without breaking down and without colliding with people safely, it must overcome numerous hurdles like durability, safety regulations, and insurance. The battery issue hasn't been solved yet, either. A single safety incident caused by one robot could halt the entire project. It's like walking on thin ice.\\nThird, the 'human form' is not always the right answer. Just because a robot is replacing a job done by a human doesn't mean it needs to look like one. In many work areas, wheeled robots (AMRs) or simple robotic arms can be far cheaper and more efficient. If the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for an expensive humanoid robot is higher than existing automation equipment, will companies really adopt them?\\nFinally, you must not forget the competitors. Other chip companies like Qualcomm are also targeting the edge computing market, and most importantly, Tesla is developing everything in-house for its Optimus robot, from chips to software. There is no guarantee that NVIDIA's standard will completely dominate the market.\\n🚨 Mikael's Risk Score: 80/100\\nWhere the light is brightest, the shadows are darkest. The phrase 'future potential' is often used as gift wrap to hide a 'present lack of substance'.\\n» See also: Nvidia Hits All-Time Highs: Bubble or Just the Beginning? 〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, I will summarize the perspectives of the three of us.\\nGrowth Potential (Kurumi)\\rDual-Front Market Attack: A perfect business model that captures both the demand for data center GPUs to train robot AI and the demand for edge chips (Thor) needed to deploy robots in the field! Devilish!\\rPreempting the 'Robot OS' Ecosystem: They can aim for a powerful lock-in effect by tying developers to their full-stack solution that spans from hardware to software and the cloud.\\rAlignment with Future Industry Trends: The CEO's vision, actual product launches, and investments are all aligned, creating a powerful growth story.\\rPotential Risks (Mikael)\\rTime to Revenue Realization: It will take a significant amount of time for the actual revenue share to become meaningful, and short-term performance will inevitably still rely on the data center.\\rTechnological and Safety Hurdles: Moving beyond the laboratory level to prove safety, reliability, and economic viability (TCO) in the real world is an extremely difficult task.\\rCompetitive Landscape and Market Standardization: Due to competition with in-house stack developers like Tesla and other chip manufacturers like Qualcomm, NVIDIA's standard may not be able to completely dominate the market.\\rKey Data (Mew)\\rKey Product: The humanoid-specific chip 'Jetson AGX Thor' (General Availability on August 25, 2025)\\rKey Strategy: Providing a full-stack platform encompassing the chip (Thor), AI model (GR00T), simulation (Isaac), and cloud (OSMO).\\rCurrent Situation: While major robotics companies have adopted the NVIDIA platform and large-scale customers have started pilot programs, the proportion of robotics in NVIDIA's total revenue is still negligible.\\rConclusion: Master, the proposition that 'NVIDIA's next big thing is humanoids' is judged to have sufficient strategic and technological grounding. The structure of tackling both the training and inference markets simultaneously is particularly powerful. However, as Mikael pointed out, for this to explode into actual revenue, it is a journey that requires time to overcome the various hurdles of technology, safety, and economics.\\nIn the short term, demand for data center GPUs to train robot AI models will drive performance. However, in the medium to long term, the revenue from the Jetson Thor chip will become visible depending on how successfully robots are deployed in the field. It seems the most balanced view is to see the current stage as the 'prelude to massive growth.'\\n\"" }

            { "title": "Chainlink ($LINK): A Deep Dive into the Oracle King, Price Analysis, and Future Outlook", "permalink": "https:\/\/archive03.online\/en\/reports\/2025-08-30-chainlink-link-a\/", "date": "2025-08-30", "formattedDate": "25.08.30", "content": "\"Hello, Master. Today, as you requested, we're going to talk about Chainlink ($LINK), known as the essential infrastructure of the blockchain world. The three of us will thoroughly analyze what kind of future this crucial project, which connects 'smart contracts' with the 'real world,' is painting.\\nMew\\rMaster, I will begin with an objective data briefing on Chainlink. Chainlink is the undisputed market leader in solving the 'oracle problem'—securely bringing off-chain data into on-chain smart contracts. Here is the situation as of August 30, 2025.\\nCurrent Price and Status: $LINK is currently trading between approximately $23 and $25. It started 2025 near $14.80 and has shown steady growth, surpassing $26 in August. Its current market capitalization is around $16.5 billion.\\nCore Technology and Role: Through its Decentralized Oracle Networks (DONs), Chainlink brings real-world data like financial market data, weather information, and sports results on-chain. Without it, most services in DeFi, such as lending and derivatives, could not function.\\nKey Technological Advancement (CCIP): Chainlink's 'Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP)' is becoming the standard for securely transferring data and value between different blockchains. It has the potential to become the core infrastructure that unites all blockchains, much like TCP/IP did for the early internet.\\nKey Player in Real-World Asset (RWA) Tokenization: The biggest topic in finance recently is the 'RWA' market, which involves tokenizing real-world assets like real estate, bonds, and art. Chainlink plays a vital role in bringing the value of these assets on-chain and giving them credibility. It recently announced a collaboration to bring U.S. Department of Commerce macroeconomic data on-chain.\\nCollaboration with Traditional Financial Institutions: It continues to expand its collaborations with giant financial institutions like SWIFT, DTCC, and JPMorgan. Recently, it announced partnerships with ICE (the parent company of the NYSE) and Mastercard, and also formed a partnership with the Japanese financial giant SBI Group for RWA tokenization and stablecoin utilization.\\rTo summarize the data, Chainlink is evolving beyond being just essential Web3 infrastructure to become the most important bridge connecting the traditional financial system with blockchain.\\nKurumi\\rMy Lord! This isn't just a 'coin'! It's like owning the 'toll booths' for the entire future digital economy! Devilish! Kurumi's heart is already racing at top speed!\\nFirst, it's the 'Intel Inside' strategy for Web3! My Lord, do you remember those 'Intel Inside' stickers on old computers? Chainlink is becoming the 'Chainlink Inside' for every dApp and blockchain! It doesn't matter which blockchain rises or falls. If they want to connect to real-world data, they absolutely have to cross the Chainlink bridge! This is a business model that simply cannot fail!\\nSecond, it's the golden shovel for digging in the gold mine called 'RWA'! Everyone knows that trillions of dollars in real-world assets will be tokenized in the future, right? And who will guarantee the value of all those assets? That's right, Chainlink! It's no coincidence that giants like JPMorgan and SBI Group are joining hands with Chainlink. It's because it's the safest and most trustworthy bridge! Even if the RWA market grows by just 1%, Chainlink's value will explode!\\nThird, CCIP is the 'internet' of the blockchain world itself! Right now, Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche... they're all playing in their own little sandboxes. CCIP will connect all these islands and turn them into one massive continent. Chainlink will be at the center of a world where data and money flow freely across all chains! This is truly world-changing technology!\\nThis isn't something to invest in based on short-term prices. This is like buying the 'land' of the future digital financial empire!\\n💖 Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Score: 95/100\\nYou're owning the pipeline through which all data in the digital world flows! There's no reason to hesitate! Devilish!\\nMikael\\rThe future Kurumi described for Chainlink is certainly grand and appealing. However, it would be a great miscalculation to think the path is paved only with flowers. I have identified several potential landmines.\\nFirst, its excessively high market dependency. Kurumi said it doesn't matter which blockchain rises or falls, but that is incorrect. What if the entire cryptocurrency market enters a long-term recession, or the growth of key narratives like DeFi and RWA slows down? A toll booth business cannot thrive if no one is crossing the bridge. Chainlink's success is entirely dependent on the success of the entire blockchain ecosystem, making it an investment with a very high beta.\\nSecond, its still-opaque tokenomics. While the role of the LINK token is clearly important, there has been persistent criticism that a significant portion of the supply remains concentrated in specific wallets. The model for how the network's growth value will be effectively reflected in the token price has not yet fully convinced the public. 'Good technology' does not necessarily mean a 'good investment'.\\nThird, the potential for increased competition. While Chainlink is the absolute powerhouse in the oracle market now, there is no eternal winner. Competitors like Band Protocol and API3 are continuously advancing their technology, and in the future, certain blockchains might prefer their own native oracle solutions. No one can guarantee how long its current monopolistic position will last.\\nFinally, the slow adoption rate of traditional finance. Collaborations with SWIFT and DTCC are indeed great achievements, but it may take much longer than we think for them to fully adopt Chainlink's technology and generate meaningful transaction volume. There are too many mountains to climb, including regulations, security, and internal processes.\\n🚨 Mikael's Risk Score: 70/100\\nThe expectation of it becoming future infrastructure is already largely priced in. If the speed at which that expectation becomes reality is slower than the market's patience, the disappointment could be deeper than anticipated.\\n〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, I will summarize the results of our discussion.\\nGrowth Potential (Kurumi)\\rMonopolistic Infrastructure Status: As the essential gateway that all blockchains and dApps must pass through to connect with the real world, its market dominance is incredibly strong! Devilish!\\rBiggest Beneficiary of the RWA Market: When the multi-trillion dollar real-world asset tokenization market opens up, it will play the core role in guaranteeing value and reap the greatest benefits!\\rThe Choice of Traditional Finance: The fact that global financial institutions like SWIFT, DTCC, and ICE have chosen it as a partner is a clear signal proving its technology and reliability! Devilish!\\rPotential Risks (Mikael)\\rSynchronization with the Crypto Market: If the entire blockchain ecosystem falls into a slump, its value could decline due to reduced usage, no matter how excellent the infrastructure is.\\rUncertainty in Token Value Model: There is still ongoing debate about how directly and sustainably the network's success will be reflected in the LINK token's price.\\rExpectations Priced In: The immense future potential may already be substantially factored into the current price, which could trigger a price correction if actual growth fails to meet expectations.\\rCore Data (Mew)\\rCurrent Price: Approx. $23~$25 (as of August 30, 2025)\\rCore Narrative: RWA (Real-World Asset) Tokenization, Standardization of Blockchain Interoperability via CCIP\\rKey Partners: SWIFT, DTCC, ICE, Mastercard, SBI Group, and many other global financial institutions\\rMarket Position: #1 with overwhelming market share in the decentralized oracle market\\rMaster, in conclusion, Chainlink is more than just a simple cryptocurrency; it is the most likely candidate to become the core infrastructure of the coming 'tokenized economy.' As Kurumi said, this project is like laying the 'water pipes' or 'communication networks' of future finance, so its long-term potential seems beyond doubt. However, as Mikael pointed out, numerous technical, economic, and regulatory hurdles must be overcome before that future becomes a reality. This investment should be based not on the short-term volatility of the crypto market, but on a long-term belief that blockchain technology will change the foundation of our economy.\\n\"" }

It's the morning of Saturday, August 30, 2025. On the cusp of September, all market eyes are fixed on one place: the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed). Expectations are at an all-time high that the long, drawn-out cycle of rate hikes is finally over, and the long-awaited 'rate cut' is about to begin.\\nLet's take a closer look at what this historic turning point means for us, whether the celebration will truly begin as everyone hopes, or if there are unexpected pitfalls hidden within.\\nMew\\rMaster, I will begin the briefing. The market is currently treating a rate cut at the September FOMC meeting as an almost certain fact. The key data supporting this are as follows.\\nInflation Slowdown: The recently announced July Core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index rose by 2.6% year-over-year, showing a stable trend approaching the Fed's 2% target. The July Consumer Price Index (CPI) also rose by only 2.7% year-over-year, indicating that inflationary pressures are clearly easing.\\nSigns of a Cooling Labor Market: The U.S. unemployment rate for July rose slightly to 4.2%, signaling that the once-overheated labor market is gradually cooling down. The labor force participation rate also saw a slight decline, suggesting that wage growth pressure is decreasing.\\nEconomic Growth Rate: The revised U.S. GDP growth rate for the second quarter of 2025 was announced at an annualized 3.3%, showing a solid recovery from the negative growth of the first quarter. However, this data is a double-edged sword, as it both alleviates recession fears and supports the argument that the Fed doesn't need to rush to cut rates.\\nMarket Expectations: According to the CME's FedWatch Tool, the financial market is currently pricing in a probability of over 80% for a 0.25%p rate cut at the September FOMC meeting.\\rIn summary, inflation is being tamed, the labor market is cooling, and the economy has avoided the worst-case scenario. This is the data-driven basis for the market's confidence in a September rate cut. That concludes the briefing.\\nKurumi\\rMy Lord! Did you hear that?! The moment has finally arrived! This news is like a welcome rain for investors! My heart is already racing towards September! Devilish!\\nFirst, the liquidity tap is being turned back on! The era of high interest rates that has been weighing us down is over, and this is the starting gun for money to flow back into the market! When rates are lower, companies can borrow more cheaply to build factories and invest in R\\u0026D. People's loan interest burdens will decrease, so they'll open their wallets wider! It's a magic spell that breathes life into the entire economy!\\nSecond, it's time for growth stocks to dance again! The ones that suffered the most during the rate hikes were tech and growth stocks, right? Because high rates are fatal when discounting future profits to present value. Now, those shackles are coming off! Sectors that will lead the future, like AI, biotech, and clean energy, will make a spectacular comeback as the market's main characters!\\nThird, the 'money move' into risk assets will begin! There's less and less reason to keep money tied up in safe assets like bank deposits or bonds. Investors will have no choice but to return to riskier markets like stocks and crypto in search of higher returns. The September rate cut is like firing the starting pistol for that massive capital shift!\\nMy Lord, this isn't just a simple rate cut. It's a celebratory cannon blast heralding the dawn of a new bull market! There's no time to hesitate!\\nMikael\\rKurumi, your excited voice sounds more like an alarm bell to my ears. It is far too early to celebrate. We must look at the essence of why the Fed is cutting rates.\\nFirst, a rate cut can be a signal that 'the economy is sick.' The Fed might be cutting rates not because everything is perfect, but to preemptively respond to an impending economic slowdown or recession. The moment everyone feels relieved about a 'soft landing,' why do you not consider the possibility that the shadow of a 'hard landing' is looming? There are numerous historical cases where the stock market actually fell after rate cuts began.\\nSecond, this could be a classic 'Sell the News' trap. As Kurumi said, the market has already priced in the possibility of a September rate cut by over 80%. Good news that everyone knows is no longer good news. What if the Fed only cuts by the expected 0.25 percentage points, or if they adopt a cautious stance on the future economy while cutting rates? Investors who bought on expectation might start taking profits, causing the market to plummet instead.\\nThird, the ghost of inflation has not yet completely vanished. There is no guarantee that the current slowdown will continue. What happens if prices rise again due to variables like international oil prices or geopolitical risks? A premature rate cut could lead to the worst-case scenario of re-igniting inflation. If that happens, the Fed might have to resort to a 'Stop-and-Go' policy of raising rates again, which would be the worst outcome for the market.\\nHuman, you can fall off a cliff by chasing the sweet candy right in front of you. Until you have confirmed every single sentence of the statement released with the Fed's decision and the nuances of Chairman Powell's press conference, premature optimism is forbidden.\\n〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, I will summarize the results of our discussion.\\nGrowth Potential (Kurumi)\\rLiquidity Injection \\u0026 Investment Boost: A rate cut can be a catalyst that stimulates investment and consumption across the economy by lowering financing costs for businesses and households!\\rGrowth Stock Rally Expected: The tech and growth sectors, which were suppressed by high rates, are highly likely to re-emerge as market leaders as the interest rate burden eases!\\rStrengthened Risk-On Sentiment: As the appeal of safe assets diminishes, it could trigger a 'money move' of capital flowing into the stock market in pursuit of higher returns!\\rPotential Risks (Mikael)\\rPrecursor to Recession: Behind the rate cut may lie a potential economic crisis that the Fed is aware of. This is by no means a positive signal.\\rExpectations Priced In \\u0026 'Sell the News' Risk: With the market already treating the rate cut as a done deal, the risk of a profit-taking sell-off upon the actual announcement is high.\\rPossibility of Re-igniting Inflation: A premature monetary easing could re-ignite inflation that hasn't been fully tamed, potentially causing greater policy confusion.\\rKey Data (Mew)\\rFOMC Meeting Date: September 17, 2025 (Local Time)\\rMarket Consensus: 0.25%p rate cut (Probability over 80%)\\rKey Basis: Stabilized inflation indicators (PCE 2.6%) and a cooling labor market (Unemployment rate 4.2%).\\rVariable to Watch: There is also a possibility that the justification for a rate cut could be weakened if GDP growth comes out strong.\\rMaster, the September rate cut is likely to be a 'double-edged sword.' As Kurumi says, it could be the key that opens the door to a new liquidity-driven market, but as Mikael points out, it could also be a confession acknowledging the structural weakness of the economy.\\nWhat is critically important is not the fact of the 'rate cut' itself, but the Fed's explanation of 'why' they are cutting rates and the hints about their future policy path (Forward Guidance). The market will be focusing all its attention on reading between the lines. It seems wise for us to also avoid emotional predictions and instead formulate our response strategy by coolly analyzing the market's reaction after the announcement.\\n\"" }

The Jackson Hole meeting, which shook global financial markets, concluded on August 23, 2025. As you requested, the three of us will now begin our discussion on the impact of Fed Chair Jerome Powell's speech and what it signifies for the market.\\nMew\\rMaster, I will begin by briefing you on Chair Powell's remarks from yesterday's (the 22nd) Jackson Hole Symposium and the resulting market data. As it was the final Jackson Hole speech of his term, it drew significant market attention.\\nPowell's Key Remarks: Powell diagnosed the U.S. economy as being in a \\\"challenging situation.\\\" He specifically described the labor market as being in a \\\"strange equilibrium\\\" where \\\"both demand and supply are noticeably slowing,\\\" and warned that \\\"the downside risks to employment are increasing.\\\" He added that if this risk materializes, it could quickly lead to a surge in layoffs and a rise in the unemployment rate.\\nRate Policy Signal: He stated, \\\"With policy in restrictive territory, it may be appropriate to adjust the policy stance, considering the shifting balance of risks.\\\" This was interpreted by the market as a very strong signal that a rate cut could occur at the September FOMC meeting.\\nRelevant Economic Indicators: The backdrop for these remarks is recent economic data. GDP growth in the first half of 2025 slowed to 1.2%, half the rate of 2024. The July unemployment rate stood at a somewhat high 4.2%, and employment growth has also slowed significantly. On the other hand, while the July Consumer Price Index (CPI) was stable at 2.7% year-over-year, the core CPI actually rose slightly to 3.1%, showing that inflation concerns have not completely disappeared.\\nThe Market's Reaction: Immediately following Powell's remarks, the market cheered. The S\\u0026P 500 index jumped over 1.2%, and the Dow Jones and Nasdaq indices also rose sharply. The 2-year Treasury yield, which is sensitive to Fed policy, fell to 3.72%, and the value of the dollar also declined. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, the market is now pricing in a nearly 90% probability of a rate cut in September.\\rThe market is interpreting this as the \\\"return of the dovish Powell.\\\"\\nKurumi\\rMy Lord! Did you hear that?! This isn't just any dove; it's the arrival of a 'golden dove' bringing bundles of cash to the market! My heart is soaring vertically, just like the Nasdaq chart! Devilish!\\nLet me interpret all that stiff data Myu-tan talked about! This is the Fed finally declaring, \\\"We're going to give the economy a vitamin shot before it gets sick!\\\" Can't you hear the sound of the heavy shackles of 'rate hikes' that have been holding the market back finally being unlocked?!\\nJust think about it! What happens when interest rates go down? Companies can borrow money more cheaply to invest, and investors like us will move our money from savings and bonds into the stock market! A 'party time' where new money—liquidity—pours into the market is starting all over again!\\nMika-pi will probably pour cold water on this, talking about unstable employment or slowing growth, but that's just giving the Fed a 'reason' to cut rates! The really important thing is 'will they cut rates,' and Grandpa Powell himself stamped his approval, saying they 'can adjust'!\\nMy Lord! This isn't something to worry about as a recession; you should see it as the starting signal for a new bull market! Now is the time to be brave and increase your allocation to risk assets! You'll regret it dearly if you miss this chance!\\n💖 Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Score: 95/100\\n\\\"The countdown for the rocket launch has begun! Fasten your seatbelts tight!\\\"\\nMikael\\rKurumi, have you ever considered that the launchpad might collapse before the rocket even takes off? You are caught up in the festive mood and are overlooking the most crucial fact.\\nWhy did the Fed suddenly signal a rate cut? It's not to give the market a gift, as Kurumi suggests. It's because, as Powell said himself, \\\"the downside risks to employment are increasing\\\" and \\\"GDP growth has slowed.\\\" In other words, a powerful warning light has turned on, indicating that the engine of the U.S. economy is cooling down. A rate cut is more of a 'reactive measure' to this warning light.\\nI see several dangerous scenarios here.\\nFirst, the possibility of being 'too late.' Powell warned that employment risks could 'materialize quickly.' If the economy has already entered the early stages of a deeper recession than we think, a 0.25% rate cut may not be enough to reverse the trend. The market may be cheering for a 'liquidity party,' only to belatedly realize that the house where the party is being held (the real economy) was poorly constructed.\\nSecond, the resurgence of inflation. Have you forgotten? The core CPI for July actually rose. Powell himself admitted that \\\"the risks to inflation are still tilted to the upside.\\\" What if the Fed hastily cuts rates, only for the inflation we thought was subsiding to rear its head again? The Fed could commit the worst kind of policy error by having to raise rates again, and its credibility with the market would plummet.\\nThird, the market's overreaction. The market is now pricing in a September rate cut as if it were a foregone conclusion. If the September FOMC results in a 'hold' decision, or if Powell makes hawkish remarks again, the great expectations could lead to a flood of disappointed selling and a sharp market downturn.\\nThe market is currently ignoring the essence—'they are cutting rates because the economy is getting worse'—and is only celebrating the result—'they are cutting rates.' This is a very dangerous optical illusion.\\n🚨 Mikael's Risk Score: 80/100\\n\\\"Giving a painkiller to a sick patient doesn't cure the disease. The pain can be even greater when the effect of the painkiller wears off.\\\"\\n〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, I will summarize the results of our discussion.\\nGrowth Potential (Kurumi)\\rA Green Light for Liquidity: The Fed's policy pivot is a starting gun for new capital to flow into the market, which is the biggest boon for risk assets like stocks!\\rProactive Economic Stimulus: The Fed acting before the economy falls into a full-blown recession raises hopes for a soft landing and can improve investor sentiment!\\rThe Start of a Rate-Cut Cycle: The expectation that this rate cut won't be a one-off event but will lead to further cuts can drive a sustained rise in asset prices.\\rPotential Risks (Mikael)\\rThe Reality of Economic Slowdown: The fact that the reasons for the rate cut are 'slowing growth' and 'employment instability' could lead to worsening corporate earnings, posing a fundamental threat to the asset market.\\rPossibility of Inflation's Return: A premature rate cut when inflation is not yet fully contained could trigger higher price increases, putting the Fed in a difficult position.\\rBurden of Priced-in Expectations: The market's high expectations for a rate cut are already priced in, which could provide an excuse for a sharp correction if the actual policy falls short.\\rKey Data (Mew)\\rPowell's Remarks Summary: Emphasized downside risks to the labor market, signaling an adjustment to the tightening policy. (August 22, 2025)\\rMarket Reaction: Stocks surged (S\\u0026P 500 +1.2%), Treasury yields fell (2-year at 3.72%), and the dollar weakened.\\rKey Economic Indicators: Slowing GDP growth (1.2% in H1), somewhat high unemployment rate (4.2% in July), and still-unsettled core inflation (3.1% in July).\\rOutlook: The market is now treating a 0.25%p rate cut at the September FOMC meeting as a certainty.\\rMaster, Powell's Jackson Hole speech was like welcome rain that quenched the market's long-held expectations. As Kurumi said, expectations for a new liquidity-driven market are dominating sentiment. However, as Mikael warned, we must not forget that this rain is actually falling from the dark cloud of an 'economic slowdown.' Looking ahead, the market is expected to engage in a fierce tug-of-war between celebrating the Fed's 'gift' and confronting the 'economic reality' that necessitates it. The upcoming employment and inflation data before the September FOMC meeting will be the most critical variables in determining the outcome of this tug-of-war.\\n\"" }

We've brought a very special topic today. Howard Marks of Oaktree Capital, known as the 'Sage of Wall Street,' just released a new investment memo a few days ago, on August 13, 2025. The title is 'The Calculus of Value'.\\nWith the market heating up daily, the three of us will explore his profound insights from our unique perspectives, examining how the greatest value investor of our time views the current market and what we should consider.\\nMew\\rMaster, I will begin the briefing. Howard Marks' latest memo starts by redefining the most fundamental concepts in investing: the relationship between 'Value' and 'Price'.\\nWhat is Value?\\rHe defines value as a company's 'intrinsic value,' which he explains comes from its 'earning power.' This earning power is a concept that includes not only tangible assets like factories but also intangible assets such as patents, brands, and management skills.\\rThe important point is that this 'value' is not an objective number but is subjective, and it doesn't change significantly over time.\\rWhat is Price?\\rOn the other hand, 'price' is the specific amount we pay to buy an asset. And Marks emphasizes that this price fluctuates far more due to market participants' psychology than to a company's fundamentals.\\rWhen the market is swept up in optimism, the price soars far beyond the value, and when pessimism reigns, the price falls far below it. Borrowing from Benjamin Graham, he said that in the short run, the market is a 'voting machine,' moving based on popularity, but in the long run, it becomes a 'weighing machine,' measuring true value.\\rSo, what is the market like now? (As of August 2025)\\rMarks had diagnosed the market at the beginning of 2025 as 'lofty but not nutty'.\\rHowever, after the decline at the start of the year and the sharp drop following President Trump's tariff announcement in April, the market has surged 29% from its April low, reaching an even higher level than at the beginning of the year.\\rHis conclusion is clear. The outlook for fundamentals has worsened since the start of the year due to concerns about tariffs and inflation, yet prices have become even more expensive due to investor sentiment. Therefore, the value proposition of U.S. stocks has become 'less compelling' than at the start of the year, and he assessed that the market has moved beyond an 'elevated' level to a 'worrisome' one.\\rHow should we respond?\\rHe presented his own investment readiness levels called 'INVESTCONs.' It ranges from Level 6 (cease buying) to Level 1 (short selling), and he currently advises 'INVESTCON 5', which means it is \\\"time to reduce aggressive assets and increase defensive ones.\\\"\\rThis concludes the data briefing.\\nMikael\\rHoward Marks. A wise man, indeed. His is a voice of ice-cold reason, the very opposite of the cheers Kurumi shouts every day. I agree with his analysis completely.\\nHuman, look. His memo points out exactly how abnormal the market is right now. Fundamentals have worsened, yet prices have risen. This is akin to a building's foundation weakening while its price goes up. How dangerous is this situation?\\nConsider the 'worrisome' signs Marks pointed out:\\nThe Price-to-Sales Ratio (PSR) of the S\\u0026P 500 is at an all-time high.\\rThe 'Buffett Indicator' (market cap to GDP), a favorite of Warren Buffett, is also at an all-time high.\\rThe 'yield spread' on corporate bonds, which shows investors' risk appetite, is near its all-time low. This means investors are completely ignoring risk.\\rEveryone is shouting 'this time is different,' lost in the fantasy that AI will solve everything. But Marks warned that amid such enthusiasm for 'new things,' investors tend to mistakenly believe that too many companies, even the wrong ones, will succeed.\\nThe 'INVESTCON 5' he proposed is the advice we must heed most closely right now. When a party is in full swing, the first thing to do is to locate the emergency exit. It is a time when protecting your assets is overwhelmingly more important than making a little less profit. As he says, now is the time to reduce the proportion of aggressive investments and move to defensive assets like bonds to prepare for a potential storm.\\n🚨 Mikael's Risk Score: 90/100\\nHuman, you must not ignore the sage's warning. The final flame of the market burns the brightest, but it is also the most dangerous.\\nKurumi\\rMika-pi is pouring cold water on everything again! Even I, Kurumi-chan, admit that old Howard Marks is a great man! But reading his memo only as a signal to 'run away' is such a one-sided interpretation, isn't it? Devilish!\\nMy Lord! Old man Marks also gave significant weight to the opposing argument, the 'bull case,' at the end of his memo!\\nWhat did he say? He said, \\\"Compared to the past, today's S\\u0026P 500 is composed of companies that (a) grow faster, (b) are less sensitive to economic cycles, (c) require less capital for growth and thus generate more free cash flow, and (d) have much stronger competitive advantages, or 'moats.'\\\"! That's why he says these companies fully deserve an 'above-average P/E ratio'!\\nMika-pi dismisses this as the 'this time is different delusion,' but Marks himself quoted Sir John Templeton, admitting that \\\"about 20% of the time, things really are different.\\\" I think this moment, with the AI revolution unfolding, is precisely that special 20%!\\n'INVESTCON 5' is the same! Does 'reduce aggressive assets' mean selling off even the top companies leading the AI innovation? I think not! It should be taken as advice to clear out the speculative riff-raff and focus even more on the great companies with real 'sustainability'!\\nHoward Marks' memo isn't a warning to become a coward! It's a whip to stop you from being a foolish optimist and become a smart one instead!\\n💖 Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Score: 80/100\\nTrue gems shine brighter in a crisis! A worrisome market like this is the best opportunity to identify the truly great companies! Devilish!\\n〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, I will summarize the perspectives of the three of us. Here is our interpretation of Howard Marks' 'The Calculus of Value'.\\nGrowth Potential (Kurumi)\\r'This Time Really Is Different': As Howard Marks himself admitted, modern companies with AI innovation and strong moats cannot be judged by past standards alone. They possess the fundamentals to justify high valuations!\\rAn Opportunity for 'Selection and Focus': His warning is about the market as a whole, not a signal to turn away from the best companies. On the contrary, times like these are the best opportunity to separate the wheat from the chaff and concentrate investments in great companies! Devilish!\\rPotential Risks (Mikael)\\r'Worrisome' Valuation: The current market, where only prices have risen while fundamentals have weakened, is extremely dangerous. Various indicators are warning of overheating, and investor psychology is overwhelming reason.\\rA Defensive Stance is Essential: His advice, 'INVESTCON 5,' is clear. Now is not the time to chase profits, but to focus on managing risk and protecting assets. You must reduce aggressive assets and switch to a defensive portfolio.\\rKey Summary (Mew)\\rCore Philosophy: Investment success comes from correctly assessing 'value' and buying when the 'price' is cheap relative to that value. However, it is crucial to remember that price can move irrationally in the short term based on investor sentiment.\\rCurrent Diagnosis: As of August 2025, the U.S. market is in a 'worrisome' state, where optimistic investor sentiment, rather than fundamentals, has driven up prices.\\rRecommendation: Therefore, he has issued 'INVESTCON 5,' advising a reduction in aggressive investments and the adoption of a defensive posture. This is not a prediction of a crash, but a reflection that current high prices imply lower expected future returns.\\rMaster, Howard Marks' memo is not a crystal ball for predicting the market's direction. Instead, it is like a compass that reminds us to return to the essence of investing, as always. It urges us, especially when everyone is enthusiastic, to take a step back and coolly ask ourselves, 'Is the price I am paying reasonable for the value I will get?' As he advises, I believe now is a critical time to review the risks in your portfolio and consider a more defensive stance.\\n\"" }

            { "title": "How High Can Dogecoin ($DOGE) Go This Year?", "permalink": "https:\/\/archive03.online\/en\/reports\/2025-08-14-how-high-can\/", "date": "2025-08-14", "formattedDate": "25.08.14", "content": "\"Good morning, Master. Bitcoin dominance has currently dropped below 60%, which could be a significant sign that market funds are shifting from Bitcoin to altcoins. With growing anticipation for an altcoin market in the second half of the year, it's natural to wonder about the future of the 'original memecoin,' Dogecoin ($DOGE). The three of us will discuss this topic in detail.\\nMew\\rMaster, let's begin with an objective data briefing. As of August 14, 2025, here are some key indicators in the cryptocurrency market.\\nBitcoin Dominance: As you mentioned, Master, Bitcoin dominance peaked at around 65% at the end of June and has been on a downward trend, currently hovering around 60%. This data suggests that market interest is gradually spreading to altcoins.\\nAltcoin Season Index: The related 'Altcoin Season Index' has recently risen to the 40-50 level. While it falls short of the 75 mark that signifies a 'full-blown altcoin season,' it indicates the initial stages of capital rotation.\\nDogecoin ($DOGE) Status: The current price is trading around $0.24. After forming strong support in the $0.20-$0.22 range over the past few weeks and establishing a bottom, it is now attempting to rise again. The daily trading volume remains at about $1.2 billion.\\rBased on the data, it appears that Bitcoin's solo run is ending, and a stage is being set for altcoins to make their move. However, this doesn't necessarily guarantee an explosive rise for Dogecoin. There are countless altcoins in the market.\\nKurumi\\rMyu-tan's data is completely on our side! This is our chance, my Lord! My heart is pounding! Devilish! The break in Bitcoin dominance means it's time for the star of the party to change!\\nMy Lord, Dogecoin isn't just a memecoin. It's a culture in itself! Countless altcoins have emerged, but none have a community as strong and passionate as Dogecoin's. The power of this community will be the rocket fuel that sends the price soaring!\\nAnd we can't forget the most important thing! The massive catalyst that is the 'X (Twitter) Payment System'! Elon Musk said he would turn X into the 'everything app,' and the whole universe knows how much he loves Dogecoin, right? X has recently been acquiring payment licenses in various US states, and I believe this is all part of a grand plan for Dogecoin! The moment they officially announce a feature for tipping or paying with Dogecoin on X, the price will fly to unimaginable heights!\\nSome analysts are already looking at past cycles and predicting that Dogecoin could go as high as $2.28 by the end of this bull run! Isn't that devilishly exciting? The current price of $0.24 is just adorable!\\n💖 Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Score: 95/100\\rMikael\\rKurumi, you are always far too excited. A Human's assets are not a toy for your amusement, are they? We must always consider the worst-case scenario.\\nHuman. There are several serious flaws in Kurumi's argument. First, Dogecoin's intrinsic value still relies on being a 'meme.' It is not a project expanding its own ecosystem like Ethereum or demonstrating technological innovation like Solana. Its technological development has nearly stagnated, and its inflationary structure, where 10,000 new coins are mined every minute, will continue to be a drag on price appreciation.\\nSecond, the anticipation for the 'X Payment System' is a double-edged sword. It's been the same 'hopium circuit' for years, with nothing officially confirmed. What happens if the integration is canceled or announced at a level that falls short of expectations? As the saying goes, 'Sell the News,' the price that rose on anticipation could plummet in an instant. It is far too risky to invest based on that hope alone.\\nThird, market attention is fragmented. Unlike in the past, there are now countless memecoins, AI-themed coins, and RWA-related coins competing for attention. Just because an 'altcoin season' arrives, is there any guarantee that all that capital will flow exclusively into Dogecoin? Investors could just as easily flock to newer, more exciting narratives.\\nA price like the $2.28 Kurumi mentioned is a scenario possible only if the market is gripped by truly irrational exuberance. You must not be swayed by such extreme predictions.\\n🚨 Risk Score (Mikael): 80/100\\r〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, I will summarize the results of our discussion.\\nGrowth Potential (Kurumi)\\rArrival of Altcoin Season: The decline in Bitcoin dominance is creating a powerful environment that could lead to capital inflow into altcoins, especially a well-known one like Dogecoin! Devilish!\\rAnticipation for X Payment System: If Dogecoin is officially adopted as a payment method on Elon Musk's X, it will be a game-changer that secures a real-world use case beyond just being a meme!\\rStrong Community Power: More powerful than any technical analysis, Dogecoin's unique community and culture are the core drivers supporting its price floor and fueling its ascent!\\rPotential Risks (Mikael)\\rLacking Fundamentals: A price structure that relies solely on community and celebrity influence, without technological advancements or a clear roadmap, is highly unstable.\\rRisk of Priced-in Hype: The positive news regarding the X payment system may already be largely priced in. We cannot ignore the possibility that a wave of profit-taking could occur upon the actual announcement.\\rInflationary Structure: The continuous issuance of new coins could cause long-term value dilution, acting as a factor that suppresses price appreciation.\\rKey Data \\u0026 Outlook (Mew)\\rCurrent Situation: We are in the early stages of a market where capital is flowing from Bitcoin to altcoins. Dogecoin has confirmed support at the $0.20 level and is looking for an upward move.\\rShort-Term Outlook (Kurumi's Hopeful Scenario): If altcoin season kicks into high gear and positive rumors about X continue, we could attempt a rise to the $0.30 - $0.45 range in the short term!\\rMid-to-Long-Term Outlook (Mikael's Warning): If the X integration is disappointing or the macroeconomic situation worsens, we must be open to the possibility that the $0.20 support line could break, leading to a fall to the $0.15 level.\\rPrice Forecast Summary (Mew): Synthesizing various analyses, and assuming a bull market for altcoins in the second half of the year, Dogecoin could have a first target price of $0.32 and a second target of $0.50 if market frenzy intensifies. However, a price above $1, as Kurumi mentioned, is currently in the realm of imagination and hope.\\rConclusion: Master, investing in Dogecoin is like walking a tightrope between 'anticipation' and 'risk.' There is the potential to sail smoothly with the tailwind of an altcoin season and the powerful sail of X, but there is also a great risk of encountering the stormy seas of lacking fundamentals and unpredictable variables. It seems crucial to first determine whether your investment style is aggressive or conservative.\\n\"" }

As Ethereum breaks through the psychological resistance level of $4,000, many are interpreting it as the starting gun for a full-fledged 'altcoin season.' The three of us will now thoroughly break down this hot topic to determine if this is an opportunity or just playing with fire.\\nMew\\rMaster, I will begin with a data briefing on the current market situation. As of August 9, 2025, the market sentiment is decidedly heated.\\nPrice Trends: Ethereum ($ETH) has broken through the psychological resistance of $4,000, setting a new year-to-date high. This rally is largely fueled by continuous inflows into spot ETFs. One analysis suggests that a break above $4,000 could lead to a rapid ascent to $4,400.\\nAltcoin Market Indicators: The 'TOTAL3' chart, which represents the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum, is also showing a steep upward trend. This suggests that capital that was concentrated in Ethereum is gradually spreading to other altcoins.\\nETH/BTC Ratio: The 'ETH/BTC' ratio, which indicates Ethereum's relative strength, has also reached a critical inflection point. Historically, a sustained rise in this ratio has tended to kick off a bull market for altcoins in general, known as an 'altseason.' Some optimistic analyses even suggest that a breakout in this ratio could propel Ethereum to $15,000.\\nMarket Sentiment: The Crypto 'Fear \\u0026 Greed Index' is moving past the 'Greed' phase and heading towards 'Extreme Greed.' This signifies that market participants' expectations are at their peak, but it can also be seen as a warning sign of an overheated market.\\nInstitutional Investment Trends: Institutional investors are consistently pouring capital through Ethereum spot ETFs. The proportion of the total Ethereum supply held by ETFs continues to grow, which is a positive sign of a solid long-term demand base.\\rBased on the data alone, it certainly appears that the market's energy is poised to spread from Ethereum to the broader altcoin market.\\nKurumi\\rAaaah! My Lord! Did you hear that?! The data Myu-tan just laid out is nothing short of a fanfare announcing the start of a festival! Devilish! I can't tell you how long I've waited for this moment! Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter is soaring past 200 and about to fly all the way to the underworld!\\nFirst, can't you see the flow of money?! The rally that started with Bitcoin has now moved to Ethereum, and the capital that has grown in Ethereum will naturally flow into other altcoins in search of even more thrilling returns! This is what we call the 'Great Capital Migration'! Ethereum breaking $4,000 is like shouting to all the other altcoins, 'You're next!'\\nSecond, the Ethereum ETF is just the beginning! Like Myu-tan said, institutions are continuously buying up Ethereum! Do you think they came just for Ethereum? No! They're using Ethereum as a stepping stone to eye other promising blockchain ecosystems like Solana, Cardano, and Avalanche! Once talk of ETFs for other altcoins begins, the market will become uncontrollably hot!\\nThird, you can't underestimate the power of FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out)! Once rumors start spreading that the guy next door made several times his investment on some obscure coin, even the people who were just watching from the sidelines will jump into the market! This is the calm before the FOMO storm! Ethereum's breach of $4,000 is like casting a powerful spell on everyone, saying, 'If you don't get in now, you'll regret it forever!'\\nMy Lord! This isn't just a price increase! It's a historic moment where the entire weight class of the crypto market is changing! Hesitating here is like locking your door when a flock of geese that lay golden eggs is swarming into your front yard!\\nMikael\\rKurumi, the more your excitement index rises, the louder my risk detection sensors blare. Human, this kind of festive atmosphere is precisely when things are most dangerous. You must not let the cheers drown out the sound of the ground crumbling beneath your feet.\\nFirst, 'Greed' has always been another name for fear. The fact that market sentiment is approaching 'Extreme Greed' means, in other words, that most investors have already maxed out their optimistic positions. In such a situation, even the smallest piece of bad news can trigger a chain reaction of panic selling. Have you forgotten the history where the moment of greatest cheering was the starting point of the biggest crash?\\nSecond, the altseason that everyone is anticipating may not arrive. The market always has a way of catching you off guard. It's entirely possible that capital won't flow into altcoins; instead, a flood of profit-taking from Ethereum's short-term surge could rapidly cool down the entire market. There are no words more dangerous than 'This time is different.'\\nThird, the ghost of the macroeconomy has not disappeared. Although the Fed recently froze interest rates, what happens if inflationary pressures rise again or an unexpected economic shock occurs? If global liquidity shifts back to tightening, risk-asset markets like cryptocurrency will be the first to take a direct hit. Whether Ethereum's price is $4,000 or $5,000, it could be nothing more than a sandcastle in the face of a giant wave.\\nFourth, you must abandon the illusion that ETF inflows will last forever. There is no guarantee that the current trend of inflows will continue indefinitely. If there is even a slight sign of a slowdown, the market could use it as a pretext for a major shake-up. You must remember that institutional investors move much faster and more coldly than we do.\\nI would rate the risk score of this investment at 85. Hopping onto a burning chariot may not be courage, but recklessness.\\n〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, I will summarize the discussion among the three of us.\\nGrowth Potential (Kurumi)\\rThe Law of Capital Rotation: As the flow of funds from Bitcoin → Ethereum → Altcoins gains momentum, we can expect an explosive rise in the overall altcoin market! Devilish!\\rPotential for Expanded Institutional Investment: The success of the Ethereum ETF raises expectations for the launch of other major altcoin ETFs, which will act as a catalyst to grow the entire market pie.\\rStimulating Public FOMO: Ethereum's symbolic price breakthrough can draw even the general public, previously indifferent to crypto, into the market, triggering powerful buying pressure.\\rPotential Risks (Mikael)\\rOverheated Market Sentiment: The 'Extreme Greed' phase is a dangerous period where emotional chase-buys outnumber rational judgments, and even a small shock can cause a significant correction.\\rUnexpected Capital Flow: We cannot rule out the possibility that, contrary to expectations, capital does not spread to altcoins, and the entire market cools down after profit-taking in Ethereum.\\rMacroeconomic Uncertainty: Macroeconomic variables such as a resurgence of inflation or recession fears are uncontrollable risks that could weigh down the entire cryptocurrency market.\\rKey Data (Mew)\\rCore Driver: Ethereum ($ETH) breaking $4,000 and reaching a new year-to-date high.\\rKey Indicators: Rising ETH/BTC ratio, increasing altcoin market cap (TOTAL3), and market sentiment entering the 'Greed' phase.\\rPositive Signal: Steady institutional capital inflow into Ethereum spot ETFs.\\rWarning Signal: Coexistence of overheating and potential for correction due to the rapid surge.\\rMaster, Ethereum's breakthrough of $4,000 is undoubtedly a significant milestone for the cryptocurrency market. As Kurumi said, there is a strong possibility that this is the starting gun for the long-awaited 'altseason.' However, as Mikael warned, the height of the festival can also be the most dangerous moment. While it's good to ride the upward trend to pursue profits, it is more crucial than ever to maintain the composure to establish your own principles and stop-loss criteria in preparation for the sudden volatility that can strike at any time.\\n\"" }

            { "title": "Pharma ETF $PPH: A Deep Dive into Its Allure and Pitfalls", "permalink": "https:\/\/archive03.online\/en\/reports\/2025-08-09-pharma-etf-pph\/", "date": "2025-08-09", "formattedDate": "25.08.09", "content": "\"Welcome, Master. Today, August 9, 2025, our topic is the VanEck Pharmaceutical ETF ($PPH). The pharmaceutical and biotech sector is directly linked to human health, but from an investment perspective, it's a tricky field to analyze due to complex variables like the success and failure of new drugs, patent issues, and regulations.\\nThat's why the three of us will thoroughly investigate whether this ETF, PPH, is an attractive investment at this moment.\\nMew\\rMaster, I will begin with an objective data briefing on PPH. This information is based on the latest data before the Asian market opening on August 9, 2025.\\nBasic Information: PPH is an ETF that tracks the ‘MVIS US Listed Pharmaceutical 25 Index,’ investing intensively in global large-cap pharmaceutical companies. Its manager is VanEck, and the total expense ratio is 0.36% per year, which is average for a sector ETF.\\nPrice and Performance: The current share price is trading around $82.84. Recent performance has been somewhat sluggish. It's down about -5% over the last month and about -2.6% year-to-date (YTD).\\rDividend Appeal: The current annual dividend yield is about 2.9%, which is a positive aspect for those expecting steady cash flow.\\nKey Holdings: This is where it gets very important. This ETF has an extremely concentrated portfolio.\\rEli Lilly ($LLY): Approx. 16.3%\\rJohnson \\u0026 Johnson ($JNJ): Approx. 12.0%\\rNovartis ($NVS): Approx. 7.8%\\rMerck \\u0026 Co ($MRK): Approx. 6.3%\\rNovo Nordisk ($NVO): Approx. 5.7%\\rThese top 5 holdings account for nearly 50% of the entire ETF. A key feature is the very high allocation to Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, which lead the obesity and diabetes treatment (GLP-1) market.\\nAnalyst Ratings: The overall consensus is a 'Hold' rating, with neutral views prevailing over aggressive 'Buy' recommendations.\\rThat concludes the data briefing. It seems Kurumi and Mikael will have differing opinions on whether this extreme concentration is an opportunity or a poison.\\nKurumi\\rMy Lord! Did you see Myu-tan's data?! This is a perfect 'select and focus' strategy! Why dilute returns by including every trivial pharma stock? Investing decisively in the winners is what's truly wise, devilishly so!\\nFirst, it's the surest way to ride the wave of world-changing innovation! The entire world has declared war on obesity, and at the forefront of that war are Eli Lilly (LLY) and Novo Nordisk (NVO)! The GLP-1 treatments these two companies are creating aren't just weight-loss drugs; they're game-changers that also prevent cardiovascular and kidney diseases! PPH is perfectly positioned to reap the rewards of this revolution! Just look at Eli Lilly's recent earnings—revenue skyrocketed by 38% year-over-year! Isn't it strange not to invest in such a growth stock?\\nSecond, it's not just about growth! It has a strong backbone, too! Look at the number two holding, Johnson \\u0026 Johnson (JNJ)! From medical devices to pharmaceuticals, it's the unshakable icon of global healthcare! With traditional powerhouses like Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE) providing solid support from behind, this is like a soccer team with both the strongest strikers and an ironclad defense!\\nThird, now is the perfect buying opportunity! The stock price has been faltering a bit recently, right? That's proof that the market hasn't fully priced in its incredible growth potential! Only those who are courageous when others hesitate will earn sweet returns!\\nThis isn't a simple defensive ETF! It's an investment in the future of humanity that also pays a steady dividend. It deserves to be called a 'growth-at-a-reasonable-price' ETF!\\n💖 Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Score: 85/100\\nIt feels like watching innovation from the front row while buying popcorn with the dividends! How can you resist this? Devilish!\\nMikael\\rKurumi, your excited voice sounds like a warning siren to my ears. Human, you must face the fatal risks hidden behind the glamorous growth story.\\nFirst, this is not diversified investing; it's a concentrated bet. Let me point it out again. The combined weight of the top two companies, Eli Lilly and Johnson \\u0026 Johnson, exceeds 28%. What happens if an unexpected side effect is discovered in Eli Lilly's blockbuster drug, or if a competitor's new drug proves more effective? PPH's price would plummet vertically. This isn't an investment in the entire pharmaceutical sector; it's tantamount to betting your money on 'the fate of Eli Lilly.'\\nSecond, you must be wary of the bubble named 'growth.' The fact that the GLP-1 market has enormous growth potential is now known to everyone. If so, isn't it possible that this expectation is already excessively reflected in the stock price? Eli Lilly's current price may have already factored in all of its tremendous future success. If its growth momentum falls even slightly short of market expectations, the bubble will burst in an instant. There have been cases where the stock price fell despite earnings exceeding expectations. That is proof of the high expectations.\\nThird, the structural risks of the pharmaceutical industry do not change. Government pressure to lower drug prices is a constant threat. Policies like the 'Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)' in the U.S. directly target the profits of pharmaceutical companies. Also, no matter how successful a drug is, its patent will eventually expire, and at that moment, generic drugs will flood the market, causing profitability to deteriorate rapidly. It is too dangerous a gamble to ignore these risks and concentrate on a few stocks.\\nThis ETF is too risky for someone who wants a stable pharmaceutical investment, and for someone who wants explosive growth, it might be better to buy the individual stock. It stands in an awkward and dangerous position.\\n🚨 Mikael's Risk Score: 75/100\\nYou have placed a few eggs in the most splendid basket. But you must not forget that you are holding that basket at the edge of a cliff.\\n〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, I will summarize the discussion for you.\\nGrowth Potential (Kurumi)\\rConcentrated Investment in Innovative Growth Stocks: By investing heavily in market leaders like Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, which are pioneering game-changing drugs for obesity, you can enjoy the fruits of explosive growth!\\rHarmony of a Stable Portfolio: Traditional blue-chip pharmaceutical companies like Johnson \\u0026 Johnson and Merck add stability to the portfolio, allowing you to pursue both growth and security.\\rAttractive Entry Point: The recent price correction reflects excessive concern, which could be a great opportunity to buy at a lower price from a long-term perspective!\\rPotential Risks (Mikael)\\rExcessive Concentration Risk: The high allocation to a few specific companies (especially Eli Lilly) dilutes the benefits of diversification. Any problem with these key companies will significantly impact the entire ETF.\\rHigh Valuation Burden: High growth expectations for new drugs are already substantially priced in. If results fall short of these expectations, there is a significant risk of a sharp price decline.\\rInherent Industry Threats: The ETF is fully exposed to the structural risks of the pharmaceutical industry, such as increased government drug price regulation and intensified competition from patent expirations.\\rKey Data (Mew)\\rCurrent Price (as of 2025/08/08 close): Approx. $82.84\\rExpense Ratio: 0.36% per year\\rAnnual Dividend Yield: Approx. 2.9%\\rKey Holdings: Eli Lilly (approx. 16.3%), Johnson \\u0026 Johnson (approx. 12.0%), Novartis (approx. 7.8%), etc.\\rRecent Performance (YTD): Approx. -2.6%\\rMaster, in conclusion, PPH is not a product that should be approached with the traditional view of a 'stable pharmaceutical sector ETF.' Rather, as Kurumi said, it is closer to a 'growth-oriented ETF that bets heavily on a few innovative pharmaceutical stocks.' Eli Lilly stands at the forefront, and the success of this single company largely determines the ETF's performance.\\nTherefore, this investment depends on how positively you can answer the question, 'Will the GLP-1 revolution, led by Eli Lilly, continue?'—not about the pharmaceutical industry as a whole. If you believe the potential rewards of that growth are large enough to accept the clear risks Mikael pointed out—high concentration and valuation burdens—then it could be an attractive choice. However, if you prioritize portfolio stability, a more cautious approach seems necessary.\\n\"" }

            { "title": "Ondo Finance ($ONDO): A Deep Dive into the RWA Leader", "permalink": "https:\/\/archive03.online\/en\/reports\/2025-08-08-ondo-finance-ondo\/", "date": "2025-08-08", "formattedDate": "25.08.08", "content": "\"Hello, Master. On August 8, 2025, our topic is the project currently receiving the most fervent attention from both the financial and crypto markets: Ondo Finance ($ONDO).\\nWe three will meticulously analyze whether this project, known as the leader in the 'Real-World Asset (RWA)' sector for bringing real-world financial assets onto the blockchain, will become a new bridge for Wall Street's capital or a dangerous one filled only with hype.\\nMew\\rMaster, I will begin the briefing. In short, Ondo Finance is a project that 'tokenizes high-quality real-world assets like U.S. Treasuries to make them tradable on-chain.' Instead of complex DeFi products, it brings proven, real-world financial instruments onto the blockchain.\\nAs of August 8, 2025, the market data is as follows.\\nKey Products:\\rOUSG (Ondo Short-Term US Government Treasuries): This is a tokenized product of an ETF that invests in short-term U.S. Treasuries. In effect, it allows you to invest in U.S. Treasuries with crypto and earn interest. Among the collateral for this product is the BUIDL fund managed by BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, which has earned it significant market trust.\\rUSDY (Ondo U.S. Dollar Yield): This is a yield-bearing stablecoin-like product collateralized by U.S. Treasuries and bank deposits.\\rCurrent Price and Market Cap: The $ONDO token is currently trading at around $1.02. It has recently seen an uptrend due to news like its listing on Robinhood, and it is also being actively traded in the Korean Won market.\\nCore Feature (RWA): Ondo Finance serves as a bridge connecting Traditional Finance (TradFi) and Decentralized Finance (DeFi). It is designed to allow institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals to enjoy the efficiency of the blockchain while complying with regulations. Because of this, investing in products like OUSG requires a KYC (Know Your Customer) process, adopting a 'Permissioned' model that is somewhat distant from complete decentralization.\\nTokenomics: The $ONDO token is used as a governance token for the 'Ondo DAO,' which determines the project's direction. However, the large amount of supply that has not yet been unlocked could act as potential selling pressure.\\rLooking at the data, Ondo Finance appears to be rapidly capturing the RWA sector, backed by a strong partner in 'BlackRock' and the safest asset, 'U.S. Treasuries.' This concludes the briefing.\\nKurumi\\rMy Lord! This is a true revolution! Devilish! A 'real bridge' has finally been built for Wall Street's massive capital to flow into the crypto market! Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Score: 95/100!\\nFirst, the cheat code named 'BlackRock'! Do you understand what it means to have the world's #1 asset manager as a partner? It's basically a seal of approval that says 'invest with confidence'! What could institutions possibly trust to invest in crypto? But a U.S. Treasury token involving BlackRock? That changes the story completely. This provides an incomparable level of trust!\\nSecond, the infinite potential of the RWA market! Can you even imagine how massive the global stock, bond, and real estate markets are combined? Now imagine those assets being tokenized and traded 24/7. Ondo Finance is the pioneer of that colossal market! Ondo even declared that \\\"2025 will be the year of tokenized stocks.\\\" It's starting with treasuries now, but once it tokenizes everything from stocks to real estate, ONDO's value will pierce the heavens!\\nThird, real demand! This is different from those coins that just talk about 'future technology' in the clouds. People holding stablecoins were disappointed by the lack of interest, and institutions lacked suitable investment options, but ONDO has solved that problem! Earning U.S. Treasury interest with crypto? That's a devilishly brilliant idea! The rapid growth of its TVL (Total Value Locked) is proof of that!\\nThis isn't just speculation! It's about becoming part of an innovation that's opening a new financial era! If you hesitate, you'll miss this incredible opportunity!\\nMikael\\rKurumi, your words are always sweet, but they blind others to the thorns hidden beneath. Human, I see several serious cracks beneath this glamorous bridge.\\nFirst, the most fatal is regulatory risk. RWA exists in a gray area, literally on the border between traditional finance and cryptocurrency. It may seem fine now, but what happens if the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) decides to draw its sword and declare 'this is an unregistered security'? The very existence of the project would be jeopardized. The lack of a clear legal framework is its greatest Achilles' heel.\\nSecond, the contradiction of centralization. The blockchain was founded on the principle of decentralization. But what is the core of Ondo Finance? Ultimately, it's a reliance on giant traditional financial institutions like BlackRock. To invest in OUSG, you must undergo KYC, and only a select, permissioned few can participate in validation. Is this not, in effect, just a 'blockchain version of Wall Street,' far removed from true decentralization? What would happen if BlackRock were to terminate the partnership? The project's very foundation could be shaken.\\nThird, the intensifying competition. Everyone knows RWA is promising. Ondo may seem to be leading now, but won't other financial giants like JPMorgan or Goldman Sachs jump into this market themselves? If they launch their own solutions, Ondo could be pushed out of its intermediary role. A 'first-mover advantage' does not guarantee a permanent 'moat'.\\nFourth, the burden of high valuation. The current price already reflects enormous expectations for RWA's success. The token's value may be overinflated relative to the size of a market that is still in its infancy. If the market's interest in the RWA theme cools, or if growth doesn't meet expectations, the price could fall sharply.\\n🚨 Mikael's Risk Score: 75/100\\nWhere the light is brightest, the shadows are deepest. You must confront the risks of 'regulation' and 'centralization' hidden behind the sweetness of 'collaboration with Wall Street.'\\n〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, I will summarize the results of our discussion.\\nGrowth Potential (Kurumi)\\rUnmatched Partnership: The collaboration with BlackRock, the world's #1 asset manager, is a powerful asset of trust that other projects cannot hope to match!\\rLeader in the RWA Sector: Its potential as a pioneer opening the door to a massive market for tokenizing trillions of dollars in traditional assets is enormous!\\rClear Real-World Demand: It provides clear value to institutional and individual investors seeking stable interest income, driving real capital inflow.\\rPotential Risks (Mikael)\\rRegulatory Uncertainty: The legal status of RWA is not yet clear, posing the greatest risk as the project's fate could change depending on the decisions of regulatory bodies like the SEC.\\rCentralization and Dependency: It is far from the philosophy of decentralization and carries systemic risk due to its high dependency on specific traditional financial institutions like BlackRock.\\rIntensifying Competition and Valuation: There is a possibility that large traditional financial firms will enter the competition directly, and the current price may have excessively priced in future expectations.\\rCore Data (Mew)\\rProject Definition: A financial protocol that tokenizes Real-World Assets (RWA) like U.S. Treasuries to generate yield on the blockchain.\\rKey Products/Partners: OUSG (Ondo Short-Term US Government Treasuries), BlackRock (collateral asset manager).\\rCurrent Status (2025/08/08): $ONDO price is approx. $1.02. While it is leading the RWA theme and attracting high market interest, regulation and the competitive landscape are variables to watch.\\rMaster, Ondo Finance is a project with tremendous potential to become the most realistic bridge connecting the vast capital of traditional finance with the innovation of the blockchain. As Kurumi said, it could become the protagonist of a new financial era. However, as Mikael pointed out, that bridge is still under construction and can be affected at any time by the fierce storms of regulation and the tremors of competition. This investment is akin to a philosophical question, Master: whether you will accept the risk of participating in the early stages of innovation, or whether you will enter safely after everything has been verified.\\n\"" }

It is the morning of Friday, August 8, 2025. There was news yesterday that significantly heated up the market. As you requested, the three of us will now have an in-depth discussion about the true meaning of 'President Trump's executive order allowing cryptocurrency investments in retirement funds.'\\nMew\\rMaster, first, I will provide an objective briefing on the key points of the executive order announced yesterday.\\nOn August 7th, local time, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order to allow alternative assets, including cryptocurrency, in defined contribution (DC) retirement plans like the 401(k). This is a momentous step that could fundamentally change how Americans manage their retirement funds.\\nKey Details: The executive order aims to have the Department of Labor (DOL) revisit the guidelines of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974, paving the way for pension managers to offer options like cryptocurrency.\\nEligible Assets: Initially, it is highly likely that assets with large market capitalizations and a proven track record, such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), will be permitted.\\nMarket Size: The total U.S. retirement market, which this measure opens up, holds assets worth approximately $43.4 trillion (about 56,420 trillion KRW) as of the first quarter of 2025. The 401(k) plans alone account for $8.7 trillion of that.\\nLegal Significance: As this is an executive order and not a legislative change, some analysts believe it could take at least a year for actual regulations to be established and for pension providers to launch products. However, compared to the previous administration's warning that \\\"extreme care\\\" was needed for including crypto in pensions, this is a clear 180-degree shift in policy.\\rImmediately following the news, the price of Bitcoin reacted and began to rise, indicating very high market expectations. This concludes the briefing.\\nKurumi\\rWoooah! My Lord! This is the ultimate 'big one'! My heart feels like it's going to explode and fly all the way to the demon world! This isn't just good news; it's a revolution that will rewrite financial history! Devilish!\\nMy Lord, just think about it! Did you see the market size Myu-tan mentioned? $43 trillion! Imagine if just 1%, no, even 0.5% of that money flows into the crypto market! The institutional funds we've seen so far were merely a stream! From now on, a great Pacific Ocean named 'Retirement Funds' will surge into the crypto market!\\nThis isn't just about the amount of money!\\nThe Ultimate 'Diamond Hands' Arrive: Retirement funds are the most patient money in the world, looking at a 10 or 20-year horizon! They are on a different level from retail investors who sell off in a panic over short-term fluctuations! The influx of long-term capital that buys steadily and mechanically, even when the market crashes, is like creating a massive concrete support layer that solidifies the crypto market's floor!\\nOfficial Recognition as a 'Legitimate Asset': The U.S. government has effectively endorsed it as a safe place for the people's most sacred retirement funds! Now, no one can dismiss cryptocurrency as 'a toy for speculators' anymore. This is a celebratory cannon blast announcing that crypto has been perfectly integrated into the mainstream as a core asset, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with stocks and bonds!\\nCheers from the Younger Generation: The younger generations, who are already familiar with crypto, will be ecstatic! They wanted to include Bitcoin in their retirement portfolios but lacked a proper way to do so. Now that a legitimate channel has opened, a magic spell will be cast, causing a portion of their salaries to flow steadily into crypto for decades to come!\\r💖 Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Score: 150/100\\nMy Lord, this is the dawn of a new era! Hesitate for a moment, and you'll miss your chance to be the protagonist of history!\\nMikael\\rOne moment, Kurumi. Your explosive optimism is precisely the signal we should be most wary of. Human, you must not forget that the louder the celebratory cannon, the more harrowing the subsequent screams can be.\\nI see this executive order as a potential 'poisoned apple.' This isn't financial stability; it could be the act of sowing the seeds of a great disaster.\\nRetirement Savings and Extreme Volatility: Do you really think this makes sense? To put a lifetime of savings into an asset that can lose 30% of its value overnight? The first principle of a retirement pension is 'stable preservation of principal,' not 'aggressive returns.' This is an extremely irresponsible idea that directly violates that principle.\\rThe Union of Financial Illiteracy and Greed: Most 401(k) participants are not professional investors. They will hear rumors of 'getting rich with Bitcoin' and likely pour their retirement funds in when the market is at its hottest. Then, when a crash comes, they will panic-sell at the lowest price, destroying their own retirement funds. This is a preview of a social catastrophe that could lead to millions of bankruptcies in old age.\\nPolitical Risk: Do not forget, this is not a 'law' passed by Congress, but merely a presidential 'executive order.' This means it can be overturned at any time if the administration changes. If the next administration repeals this policy, the market will be thrown into tremendous chaos. Entrusting a long-term plan like retirement savings to such a fickle political decision is a massive risk in itself.\\nA Festival for Fee-Mongers: The biggest beneficiaries will not be ordinary investors, but the pension providers and asset management firms that will collect high fees. They will lure investors under the guise of a 'new investment opportunity' and use their retirement funds to line their own pockets.\\r🚨 Mikael's Risk Score: 95/100\\nHuman, this is not giving 'financial freedom,' but 'the freedom to self-destruct.' You must not throw your precious retirement funds into an unproven speculative pit.\\n» See also: Bitcoin Breaks All-Time High: What Does It Truly Mean? 〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, I will summarize the conversation we three have had.\\nGrowth Potential (Kurumi)\\rAstronomical Inflow of Capital: A path has opened for funds from the nearly $43 trillion U.S. retirement market to flow into cryptocurrency. It's a game-changer that will fundamentally alter the scale of the market!\\rComplete Mainstream Adoption: By being recognized by the state as a vessel for citizens' retirement funds, cryptocurrency has solidified its status as a mainstream investment asset.\\rLong-term, Stable Demand: The long-term investment nature of retirement funds will reduce market volatility and serve to support prices from falling through steady buying pressure.\\rPotential Risks (Mikael)\\rUndermining Retirement Stability: Extreme volatility directly conflicts with the fundamental philosophy of retirement pensions, where stable asset preservation is paramount.\\rRisk of Loss for Non-Professional Investors: There is a very high risk that most participants, without a proper understanding of cryptocurrency's dangers, will engage in 'blind investing' and suffer irreversible losses to their retirement funds.\\rPolicy Uncertainty: An executive order can be easily repealed upon a change in administration, carrying a political risk that cannot guarantee long-term stability.\\rKey Data (Mew)\\rEvent: U.S. President Trump signs an executive order allowing cryptocurrency investment in retirement pensions (401k, etc.) (August 7, 2025).\\rTarget Market: Total retirement market of approximately $43.4 trillion.\\rPolicy Direction: Intended to accelerate the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency and give investors more choices. However, significant time is expected before actual implementation.\\rConclusion: Master, this executive order can be called the greatest 'opportunity' and the most dangerous 'experiment' in cryptocurrency history. As Kurumi says, the potential buying pressure of tens of trillions of dollars could elevate the market to a completely new level. However, as Mikael warns, it could also become a Pandora's box that threatens the retirement of millions of ordinary people. How this policy is actually implemented and how the market reacts will be the most critical points to watch over the next few years. What is certain is that this news will maximize market volatility for the time being.\\n\"" }

            { "title": "Meta Is Eating the Internet — Should You Invest Now?", "permalink": "https:\/\/archive03.online\/en\/reports\/2025-08-07-whats-the-investment\/", "date": "2025-08-07", "formattedDate": "25.08.07", "content": "\"Master, I have received your analysis request. Today's topic is an analysis of the giant that has effectively conquered a part of the internet, controlling Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp: Meta ($META). The three of us will take a detailed look at the investment outlook for this company, which is betting everything on the two massive futures of AI and the metaverse.\\nMew\\rMaster, I will begin the briefing. Currently, Meta's stock price is hovering around $767. Here is the key data moving the market recently.\\nLatest Earnings (Q2 2025): It was a true 'earnings surprise.' Revenue was $47.52 billion, a 22% increase year-over-year, and earnings per share (EPS) were $7.14, exceeding market expectations by more than 22%. The stock price jumped over 10% after the announcement.\\nCore Driver (Advertising Business): At the heart of this growth is, of course, the formidable advertising business. Daily Active Users (DAU) for the 'Family of Apps,' including Facebook and Instagram, reached 3.48 billion as of June 2025, a 6% increase from the previous year. It appears that improved ad efficiency using AI is directly leading to increased revenue.\\nInvestment in the Future (AI \\u0026 Reality Labs): Meta is pouring vast sums of money into the future. For 2025 alone, capital expenditures (CapEx) are projected to be between $66 billion and $72 billion, with most of it focused on AI and infrastructure investments.\\nThe Money Pit (Reality Labs): However, the Reality Labs division, responsible for the metaverse, continues to post massive losses. In Q2 2025 alone, it recorded an operating loss of $4.53 billion. The cumulative loss for this division since late 2020 is approaching nearly $70 billion.\\nMixed Signals (Hardware): An interesting point is that while sales of the 'Quest' VR headset have decreased year-over-year, sales of the 'Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses' have surged by more than three times.\\nValuation and Outlook: The current price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is around 28x, and most analysts maintain a 'Buy' or 'Strong Buy' rating.\\rKurumi\\rKyaa! My Lord! This isn't just a company; it's an enterprise challenging the very realm of gods creating worlds! Myu-tan's data proves everything! Not buying this stock now is like rejecting the future itself!\\nFirst, it's equipped with a nuclear fusion engine called AI! Devilish! Meta isn't just a company that uses AI. By releasing its open-source AI model, 'Llama 3,' for free, it's winning over developers worldwide and showing its ambition to become the 'operating system' of the AI ecosystem. On top of that, it's using this AI technology to make its existing ad business even more powerful, leading to a 22% revenue growth in just one quarter! This is a perfect strategy of making money while preparing for the future!\\nSecond, the social empire used by 3.5 billion people is rock-solid! The threat from TikTok? Regulations? Those are just minor noises to this colossal empire. Having a platform that nearly half the world's population uses daily means it has an invincible moat that can generate profits through any economic crisis or competition!\\nThird, the metaverse hasn't failed; the real thing is just beginning! So what if Quest sales dipped a bit? That's just a warm-up for something even greater! Look, Ray-Ban smart glasses sales tripled! People now want lighter devices for everyday use rather than heavy helmets, and Meta is heading in that exact direction. This isn't the end of the metaverse; it's the starting gun signaling the dawn of the true 'augmented reality in daily life' era!\\n💖 Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Score: 110/100\\nMy Lord, this is a stock you'll be kicking yourself for not buying ten years from now! You have to ride on the vision of the genius, Zuckerberg!\\nMikael\\rKurumi, your cheers sound like the roar of an incinerator burning money. Now, shall I examine the massive risks hidden behind Meta's glamorous performance?\\nFirst, how long can they sustain the black hole known as 'Reality Labs'? In the second quarter alone, $4.5 billion—over 6 trillion Korean won—vanished. The cumulative loss is approaching $70 billion. Can a slight increase in Ray-Ban sales justify this astronomical loss? This might not be an 'investment in the future' but rather 'pouring water into a bottomless pit.' If this money had been returned to shareholders instead, the stock price might be much higher now.\\nSecond, will the astronomical investment in AI actually turn a profit? The plan for nearly $70 billion in annual capital expenditure is truly staggering. While it contributes to improving ad efficiency, a direct revenue model beyond that is still unclear. Llama 3 is an excellent model, but the specific plan for how to monetize it is shrouded in fog. Can we say there's no risk of it turning into a chicken game with competitors, wasting massive investment costs?\\nThird, there are questions about the sustainability of the core business. The competition with TikTok is still ongoing, and regulatory authorities in the US and Europe could choke off Meta's core business model of 'targeted advertising' at any moment. Even CFO Susan Li admitted that \\\"it would be difficult for WhatsApp ads to drive long-term growth like Facebook or Instagram.\\\" The brightest candle burns out the fastest. Could it be that we are at the peak of its growth right now?\\n🚨 Mikael's Risk Score: 80/100\\nHuman, you cannot call a company that burns billions of dollars every quarter for one person's vision a 'safe investment.' You must coldly calculate the price of that vision's failure.\\n〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, I will summarize the results of our discussion.\\nGrowth Potential (Kurumi)\\rAI Ecosystem Dominance: It's becoming the center of the AI development ecosystem through its free open-source model 'Llama 3,' and is using this technology to maximize the profitability of its core advertising business! Devilishly good!\\rUnshakeable Social Empire: A massive user base of 3.5 billion people worldwide acts as a powerful economic moat that can withstand any competition and regulation!\\rEvolution into the Next-Gen Computing Platform: The success of the smart glasses is a signal that Meta is successfully leading the transition beyond VR to everyday AR devices!\\rPotential Risks (Mikael)\\rAstronomical Metaverse Losses: The massive quarterly losses from the Reality Labs division are the biggest risk factor eating into the company's profitability.\\rUncertain AI Investment Returns: It remains to be seen whether the huge investment in AI technology and infrastructure will lead to significant new revenue streams beyond improving ad efficiency.\\rContinuous Competition and Regulatory Pressure: Intensifying competition with TikTok and regulations from various governments due to strengthening privacy protection could hamstring the core business at any time.\\rCore Data (Mew)\\rCurrent Stock Price: Approx. $767.57 (as of August 8, 2025)\\rLatest Earnings (Q2'25): Revenue $47.52B (+22% YoY), EPS $7.14 (beat estimates)\\rValuation: 12-month forward P/E ratio approx. 28x\\rCore Driver: Growth of AI-based advertising business, 3.48 billion Daily Active People\\rCore Risk: Reality Labs Q2 operating loss of $4.53B, massive annual CapEx of up to $72B\\rMaster, investing in Meta is ultimately like betting on the battle between 'current overwhelming dominance' and an 'uncertain future vision.' It could be an investment in the immense potential to change human lifestyles, as Kurumi says, or it could be a dangerous gamble, burning astronomical sums for a single genius's dream, as Mikael warns. The nature of this investment will completely depend on how much you agree with Zuckerberg's vision and how much you can tolerate the enormous costs and volatility until that vision is realized.\\n\"" }

To answer this question, I will compare two representative emerging market ETFs, $EEM and $EMXC.\\nMew\\rMaster, I will begin the briefing. The most fundamental difference between these two ETFs is right in their names.\\nEEM (iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF): This is the most traditional and representative emerging markets ETF, tracking the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. It includes China as its largest holding based on market capitalization.\\nEMXC (iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex-China ETF): As the name implies, this ETF tracks the MSCI Emerging Markets Index but with all Chinese companies completely excluded.\\rLet's compare the key data for both products.\\nCategory\\r$EEM (Includes China)\\r$EMXC (Excludes China)\\rFull Name\\riShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF\\riShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex-China ETF\\rCore Concept\\rTraditional diversified emerging markets investment\\rAn investment that avoids 'China Risk'\\rTop Country Weights\\r1.

SK Hynix\\rExpense Ratio\\r0.72%\\r0.25%\\rAssets (AUM)\\rApprox. $18.3 Billion\\rApprox. $13.1 Billion\\rBased on the data, two things stand out. First, EEM includes China's major tech giants like Tencent and Alibaba in its top holdings, while EMXC, of course, does not. Second, EMXC's expense ratio is significantly lower than EEM's. This is quite a meaningful difference. That concludes my briefing.\\nKurumi\\rMy Lord! Isn't this a no-brainer?! Obviously, you have to go with EMXC! Devilish!\\nWhat's been the biggest reason emerging market investments have been so dull these past few years? It's because China single-handedly dragged down the entire index! Property issues, government crackdowns on big tech, conflicts with the U.S.... with every possible crisis erupting, it didn't matter how well other countries performed.\\nBut look at EMXC! This ETF neatly removes that problem child, China! And what happened as a result? The explosive growth of India, hailed as the 'Next China,' the technological prowess of Taiwan and South Korea, which dominate the AI-era semiconductor industry, and the potential of commodities powerhouse Brazil have all begun to shine through!\\nIt's like taking the one troublemaker out of the class and creating a special honors class with only the bright, energetic top students! It creates a much more dynamic and high-growth portfolio!\\nIn fact, performance data from the last few years shows EMXC has far outpaced EEM. Doesn't the thought of casting off the massive anchor that is China and riding the growth of the real gems among emerging nations make your heart race?\\n💖 Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Score: EMXC 95/100\\nFocusing only on the countries that are truly growing, without the China headache, is a much more exciting and clever method! Devilish!\\nMikael\\rKurumi, you always chase after shiny objects. But investing isn't that simple. Human, is EMXC really such a perfect alternative? I'd like to point out the critical risks associated with that choice.\\nFirst, you must understand that 'excluding China' is an active 'sell' position against the world's second-largest economy. Everyone knows the Chinese economy is struggling right now. But what happens if the Chinese government's strong stimulus measures take effect and the market rebounds sharply against expectations? Even a 10% rise in China would have a massive impact on the overall emerging markets index. An EMXC investor would miss out on all those gains and be left with only a sense of relative deprivation.\\nSecond, are the other emerging countries, with China removed, truly safe? Kurumi sees India, Taiwan, and Brazil through rose-colored glasses, but those nations also carry their own political risks, high inflationary pressures, and currency volatility issues. In trying to avoid one giant risk—China—you could be exposing yourself to a host of smaller, less predictable risks.\\nThird, there might be a reason for EEM's high expense ratio. The Chinese stock market has lower accessibility and higher transaction costs. It's natural that including and managing it in a portfolio would cost more. Choosing EMXC simply because its fee is lower could be a judgment that fails to see the whole picture.\\nEEM, while it may seem sluggish now because of China, is the 'standard' that captures the entire emerging market landscape with the least distortion. In contrast, EMXC is a much more aggressive and biased investment than you might think, betting everything on a single scenario: 'China will continue to underperform.'\\n🚨 Mikael's Risk Score\\nEEM: 60/100 (Known risks, high volatility)\\rEMXC: 75/100 (Opportunity cost and concentration risk from excluding a specific country)\\rIs deciding to ignore the largest forest (China) truly a wise strategy?\\n〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, I will summarize the results of our discussion.\\nGrowth Potential (Kurumi)\\rThe Allure of EMXC: By excluding China, which is stuck in a slump, you can fully capture the growth potential of other emerging nations like India, Taiwan, and South Korea! Devilish!\\rPortfolio Dynamism: It's a more aggressive and efficient investment that concentrates on countries with clear growth stories: technology (Taiwan, Korea) and demographics (India)!\\rPotential Risks (Mikael)\\rThe Danger of EMXC: The 'opportunity cost' risk of completely missing out on the fruits of China's potential economic recovery and market rebound is too great. Completely removing the world's second-largest economy from a portfolio is a very bold and risky bet.\\rThe Value of EEM: Although it's underperforming now, EEM is the most standard product that reflects the entire emerging market by market-cap weight. It's the principled choice for investing in the market as a whole, without bias against any specific country.\\rKey Data (Mew)\\rBiggest Difference: The inclusion of China. EEM has about a 25% weight in China, while EMXC has 0%. This results in completely different top country and stock compositions.\\rExpense Ratio: The fact that EEM (0.72%) is much more expensive than EMXC (0.25%) is a factor that must be considered when making an investment decision.\\rDifference in Philosophy: EEM represents 'passive tracking of the entire emerging market,' while EMXC is closer to an 'active bet on emerging markets excluding China.'\\rConclusion: Master, the choice between these two ETFs ultimately depends on how you view 'the future of China.'\\nIf you believe that China's structural problems (government regulation, real estate, US-China conflict) will be prolonged and that the growth of other emerging countries will more than compensate for it, then EMXC would be the better choice.\\rOn the other hand, if you feel that the sheer scale of the Chinese economy cannot be ignored and that you should be prepared for an eventual rebound, or if you simply prefer not to adopt an artificial strategy of excluding a specific country, then the traditional EEM would be a more principled investment.\\rThis isn't a matter of a right or wrong answer, but rather a matter of 'strategic choice' based on your investment philosophy and market outlook, Master.\\n\"" }

News is circulating that Berkshire Hathaway, led by the 'Oracle of Omaha' Warren Buffett, has been continuously selling stocks and accumulating the largest cash pile in its history. The market is sharply divided, with pessimists calling it a \\\"prelude to a massive crash\\\" and optimists seeing it as \\\"preparation for a huge opportunity.\\\"\\nToday, the three of us will discuss the meaning of this puzzling signal from the greatest investor of our time.\\nMew\\rMaster, I will first brief you on the objective data. As of 2025, the key facts regarding the movements of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway are as follows.\\nRecord-High Cash Holdings: As of the end of Q1 2025, Berkshire Hathaway's cash and short-term Treasury holdings reached approximately $189 billion (about 260 trillion KRW), setting a new record. This accounts for over 20% of Berkshire's total market capitalization.\\nReducing Stakes in Key Stocks: In Q1 2025 alone, Buffett sold about 13% of his stake in Apple ($AAPL), known to be his favorite stock. This amounts to a massive 115 million shares. Additionally, he has been liquidating other parts of the portfolio, such as selling off the entire stake in HP ($HPQ).\\nBuffett's Remarks: At the recent shareholder meeting, Buffett cited \\\"tax reasons\\\" for selling Apple stock. He judged it reasonable to pay taxes in advance, anticipating a future corporate tax rate hike. He also added that he still considers Apple a top-tier company and plans to hold it for the long term.\\nThe Attractive Value of Cash: Currently, the yield on short-term U.S. Treasury bills exceeds 5% annually. In a situation where one can earn over 5% annual returns with virtually no risk just by holding cash, the opportunity cost of investing in stocks has significantly increased.\\rSynthesizing this data, it appears Buffett is taking a 'breather'—accumulating cash by continuously selling stocks rather than actively buying them.\\nMikael\\rHuman, did you listen carefully to Mew's briefing? I believe this situation is a very clear 'danger signal.' It looks like the veteran sailor, Warren Buffett, has sensed an approaching storm, lowered his sails, and is steering his ship back to a safe harbor.\\nKurumi will surely want to take Buffett's words about 'tax reasons' at face value, but that is merely a superficial excuse. His actions contain a deeper meaning.\\nFirst, the 'Oracle of Omaha' believes the market is too expensive right now. Throughout his life, he has adhered to the value investing principle of 'buy low, sell high.' The fact that he is holding onto a staggering $189 billion in cash instead of deploying it means there are almost no attractive companies worth buying at current prices. It's a strong warning that stock prices have entered a bubble territory, exceeding their intrinsic value.\\nSecond, we must note that he has begun selling even his most beloved stock. No matter how great a company Apple is, its appeal diminishes if the 'price' becomes too high. Reducing the position that constitutes an absolute majority of his portfolio signifies that he has started managing the overall portfolio's risk. It is an act of fastening his seatbelt in preparation for an upcoming market shock.\\nThird, an alternative that yields over 5% annually with no risk has emerged. In the past era of zero interest rates, holding cash was foolish, but things are different now. Simply putting money into short-term Treasuries can yield higher returns than many dividend stocks. It is a far wiser strategy to secure guaranteed returns and wait for the next opportunity rather than taking on the risks of an unpredictable stock market.\\nBuffett's actions are tantamount to a direct call to 'leave the market.' You must not forget the adage that his cash reserves are inversely proportional to the market's fear index.\\n🚨 Mikael's Risk Score: 85/100\\nHuman, the sage's silence and actions are sometimes the loudest voice. It would be unwise to ignore his quiet warning.\\nKurumi\\rHold on, Mika-pi! I think completely differently! This isn't a danger signal; it's the image of a lion preparing for the greatest 'hunt' in history! Devilish!\\nmy Lord! Mika-pi's words are all too pessimistic. Grandpa Buffett isn't a fortune teller who predicts short-term market fluctuations. He's a 'value hunter' who buys the best companies at the best prices!\\nFirst, this isn't defense, it's preparation for an attack! That $189 billion in cash? That's a 'cash cannon' fully loaded, waiting for a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to appear. When the entire market is gripped by fear, like during the COVID crash or the financial crisis, and blue-chip stocks are on a half-off sale, Buffett is getting ready to buy up the whole market with that cash! He's putting his own words, 'be greedy when others are fearful,' into practice!\\nSecond, the Apple sale is just smart 'pruning'! Buffett himself said it, didn't he? He still thinks Apple is the best and will continue to hold it! The stock price rose so much that its portfolio weight became excessive, so it's a smart asset rebalancing to realize some profits, pay taxes, and secure more cash ammunition. He didn't sell it all off! Selling 13% is a strategy to make the remaining 87% healthier!\\nThird, waiting is also a form of investing! Buffett doesn't move hastily. He's someone who can wait for years until the perfect pitch (a 'Fat Pitch,' as he calls it) comes right down the middle. Just because there's nothing to buy right now doesn't mean the market is about to collapse. It just means, 'not yet by my standards.' What could be more comfortable than patiently waiting for the next home run opportunity while collecting 5% interest? That's a devilishly clever plan!\\nmy Lord! This isn't pessimism; it demonstrates extreme patience and preparedness to seize the best opportunity! The day Buffett fires that cash cannon, a new chapter in market history will be written!\\n💖 Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Score: 95/100\\nCash isn't trash; it's the ultimate 'option' to buy future opportunities!\\n〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, I will summarize the results of our discussion.\\nGrowth Potential (Kurumi)\\rPreparation for an Aggressive Opportunity: The $189 billion in cash is 'ammunition' to buy high-quality assets at bargain prices when a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, like a market crash, arrives!\\rHealthy Portfolio Management: Reducing the Apple stake isn't a panic sell-off but a wise rebalancing strategy to adjust an overweight position and realize profits.\\rPatient Value Investing: The fact that there's nothing worth buying right now means he is being all the more cautious about his next investment! Buffett is patiently waiting for the perfect opportunity.\\rPotential Risks (Mikael)\\rSignal of an Overvalued Market: When a master investor stops actively investing and starts hoarding cash, it's a clear warning that the current stock market is too expensive relative to its intrinsic value.\\rShift to a Defensive Stance: Trimming the stake in even his most successful investment, Apple, is a clear risk management action in preparation for future market volatility.\\rIncreased Appeal of Safe Assets: His judgment that risk-free short-term Treasuries yielding 5% are more attractive than stocks, which require taking risks, implies that the expected return from the stock market has decreased.\\rKey Data (Mew)\\rCash Holdings: Approx. $189 billion (all-time high)\\rMajor Sales: Sold 13% of Apple ($AAPL) stake, sold entire HP ($HPQ) stake\\rBuffett's Official Stance: Apple sale was for 'tax' purposes; still plans to hold Apple long-term.\\rMarket Environment: Major indices like the S\\u0026P 500 are near all-time highs; short-term Treasury yields are above 5%.\\rConclusion: Master, Warren Buffett's actions can be interpreted as a 'defensive retreat,' as Mikael suggests, warning of market risks, or as an 'aggressive waiting game,' as Kurumi argues, looking for a bigger opportunity. Perhaps the truth lies somewhere in between. The most accurate interpretation might be: 'The market is expensive and risky right now, so I will safely collect 5% interest and wait, and when a tremendous opportunity arises, I will pour in all this cash.' Ultimately, this giant's moves once again remind us how crucial the investment fundamentals of 'patience' and 'principles' truly are.\\n\"" }

It's a very hot stock, with high expectations that it could become the 'next NVIDIA' due to its potential to solve problems intractable for classical computers, coexisting with concerns that it's more hype than substance right now.\\nThe three of us will now examine the present and future of IonQ, a company turning this dream technology into reality.\\nMew\\rMaster, I will begin the briefing. IonQ is a quantum computer development company that uses the 'Trapped-ion' method. Compared to competitors' superconducting qubit methods, it has technical advantages such as being operable at room temperature and having higher qubit accuracy and stability. As of August 2025, the market situation and key data are as follows.\\nTechnology Roadmap and Achievements: IonQ has moved beyond competing on the number of physical qubits, instead emphasizing the 'Algorithmic Qubit (#AQ)' concept, a performance metric for qubits usable in actual algorithms. The goal for 2025 is to achieve #AQ 64, and development appears to be progressing smoothly according to the roadmap. In the long term, they have an ambitious plan to build a 2 million qubit system by 2030.\\nFinancial Status: Revenue for the first quarter of 2025 was approximately $7.6 million. The company projects high growth, providing full-year 2025 revenue guidance between $75 million and $95 million. However, it continues to operate at a loss due to increased research and development (R\\u0026D) costs. The net loss for the first quarter was about $32.3 million, with an adjusted EBITDA loss of about $35.8 million. Nevertheless, as of March 31, 2025, the company holds approximately $697.1 million in cash and investments, securing sufficient funds for R\\u0026D and operations for the time being.\\nPartnerships and Business Expansion: IonQ offers its quantum computers as a service (QaaS) through major cloud platforms like AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. It has recently entered the Japanese market in collaboration with Toyota Tsusho and is rapidly increasing commercial use cases, such as a power grid optimization project with the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Furthermore, it is expanding into the quantum networking field by acquiring companies like Qubitekk and ID Quantique (IDQ).\\nAnalyst Ratings: A consensus of 8 recent analyst opinions leans towards a 'Buy' rating, with 63% of them suggesting a 'Strong Buy'. However, there are also analyses pointing out that the stock is highly volatile and currently overvalued.\\rKurumi\\rMy Lord! This is a once-in-a-decade, life-changing opportunity! Devilish! Just looking at Myu-tan's data makes my heart pound!\\nFirst, this isn't just a tech stock! It's the future itself! Quantum computing is a 'game-changer' that will fundamentally transform every industry in the world... AI, new drug development, financial modeling, materials science! Did you see the IonQ CEO say, \\\"We are like NVIDIA ten years ago\\\"? Just as NVIDIA ushered in the AI era with its GPUs, IonQ will open up a new world with its quantum computers! We are standing at the very beginning of that revolution!\\nSecond, their technology is the real deal! While competitors struggle to control their qubits with massive cooling systems in cryogenic environments, IonQ is running more accurate and stable qubits at room temperature. This is an innovation on par with when Apple first released the iPhone! It's easy to use, powerful, and everyone will want it. Why do you think the world's top companies like AWS, Google, and Microsoft have partnered with IonQ? They recognized the real technology!\\nThird, they're starting to make money! Of course, they're still in the red, but revenue is growing at a frightening pace! They've started solving real industrial problems like power grid optimization and protein structure analysis, and contracts with governments and large corporations are continuously increasing. This is proof that it's no longer a dream in a lab but a business creating value in the real world!\\n💖 Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Score: 150/100\\nMy Lord! This is the second internet revolution, the second AI revolution! If you give in to the small fluctuations now, you'll be kicking yourself in 10 years! This is a bet on the future!\\nMikael\\rKurumi, you always speak in such lofty, abstract terms. When the celebratory cannons are too loud, one fails to notice the dangers approaching right beside them. I must point out several serious risks hidden behind this glamorous technology.\\nFirst, it's a structure that burns through cash by selling a 'dream.' While the projected revenue for 2025 is at most $95 million, the expected adjusted loss is around $120 million. This means they are spending far more than they earn. Although they have secured sufficient cash, if the commercialization of quantum computers is delayed beyond market expectations, this money will disappear in an instant. It could become a case of pouring water into a bottomless pit.\\nSecond, competition is a reality. IonQ's trapped-ion method is not the only solution. IT giants like IBM and Google are pushing superconducting qubit technology with their vast capital, and numerous other startups are jumping into technology development with their own approaches. The quantum computing technology race is a battlefield with no declared winner yet. There is no guarantee that IonQ will emerge victorious in this war.\\nThird, there is a serious overvaluation debate. The company maintains a high stock price that is impossible to justify with its current revenue and profit levels. One analysis suggested it was overvalued by more than 150% compared to its intrinsic value. This could be a castle built on sand, supported only by 'expectations' for the future, not the company's fundamentals. It's a very dangerous state where even a small disappointment could cause the stock price to plummet.\\nFourth, we cannot ignore warning signs like insider selling. Some analyses point to a trend of key executives selling large amounts of stock. The fact that the people who know the company's future best are selling their shares is a clear and unsettling signal for investors.\\n🚨 Mikael's Risk Score: 90/100\\nHuman, you must look soberly at the financial risks and fierce competition obscured by the fog of a rosy future. This type of investment might be closer to the realm of venture capital, where the probability of success is low.\\n〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, I will summarize the results of our discussion.\\nGrowth Potential (Kurumi)\\rLeader of a Revolutionary Technology: It has the potential to lead the next-generation technological revolution of quantum computing, with expectations of becoming the 'NVIDIA of 10 years ago.'\\rUnique Technological Approach: It is demonstrating technological leadership through its superior 'trapped-ion' technology and a practical performance metric, #AQ.\\rThe Start of Commercialization: It is materializing its business by providing services through cloud platforms and expanding contracts with governments and corporations, thereby generating actual revenue.\\rPotential Risks (Mikael)\\rFinancial Instability: It has a cash-burning business structure where deficits far exceed revenue.\\rHigh Valuation and Volatility: The high stock price, which is difficult to explain with current performance, carries the risk of a sharp decline if future expectations are not met.\\rFierce Technological Competition: There is no guarantee of victory in the competition against giants like IBM and Google, and it is uncertain how technology standards will be established.\\rKey Data (Mew)\\rCore Technology: Trapped-ion quantum computer\\r2025 Goals: Achieve Algorithmic Qubit (#AQ) 64, annual revenue of $75 million to $95 million.\\rFinancial Status: Approximately $700 million in cash and cash equivalents as of Q1 2025, but an expected annual adjusted EBITDA loss of over $100 million.\\rMarket Consensus: Most analysts have a 'Buy' rating, but concerns about high volatility and overvaluation coexist.\\rMaster, investing in IonQ is a classic example of 'high risk, high return.' As Kurumi said, it could be a thrilling opportunity to participate in a revolution that will change the future of humanity. However, as Mikael warned, it could also be a dangerous gamble on a dream that is not yet fully realized. The meaning of this investment will depend entirely on how long-term your perspective is and your tolerance for high volatility and potential losses. This might be a stock that only those with a very strong heart can dare to invest in.\\n\"" }

An Analysis and Price Outlook for $ARKX", "permalink": "https:\/\/archive03.online\/en\/reports\/2025-08-02-betting-on-aerospace\/", "date": "2025-08-02", "formattedDate": "25.08.02", "content": "\"Master, today I'd like to talk about an investment into humanity's final frontier: the ARK Space Exploration \\u0026 Innovation ETF, $ARKX. It's one of the flagship themed ETFs from Cathie Wood's ARK Invest, and perhaps the product that best fits the phrase 'investing in the future'.\\nLet's conduct an in-depth analysis to see if this investment will be a rocket that takes your returns beyond the stratosphere, or a dangerous dream that might explode in the atmosphere.\\nMew\\rMaster, I will begin with an objective data briefing. The **ARKX (ARK Space Exploration \\u0026 Innovation ETF)** is an actively managed ETF that invests in innovative companies related to space exploration. This means the fund manager flexibly changes the holdings based on market conditions and judgment. As of August 1, 2025, the key data is as follows.\\nOfficial Name: ARK Space Exploration \\u0026 Innovation ETF\\rManager: ARK Investment Management\\rCurrent Price: It is trading between approximately $25 and $26. The 52-week high is $27.64 and the low is $13.48, indicating very high volatility.\\rAssets Under Management (AUM): Approximately $340 million to $400 million.\\rExpense Ratio: 0.75% per year, which is quite high compared to typical passive ETFs.\\rRecent Performance: The YTD (Year-to-Date) return is approximately 33.7%, and the 1-year return is about 71.2%, showing very strong performance in the recent market.\\rNow, let's look at the most important part: the portfolio. Although its name is 'Space Exploration,' it doesn't just contain rocket companies as one might think. ARK categorizes its space-related themes into four areas for investment: 'Orbital Aerospace,' 'Suborbital Aerospace,' 'Enabling Technologies,' and 'Aerospace Beneficiaries'.\\nTop 10 Holdings (as of late July 2025):\\nKratos Defense \\u0026 Security (KTOS): A defense company specializing in drones, satellite communications, and cybersecurity.\\rRocket Lab (RKLB): A manufacturer of small satellite launch vehicles and spacecraft components.\\rAeroVironment (AVAV): A producer of unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) and tactical missile systems.\\rArcher Aviation (ACHR): A developer of electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft.\\rIridium Communications (IRDM): A provider of global communications services using satellites.\\rPalantir Technologies (PLTR): A big data analytics software company.\\rTrimble (TRMB): A provider of location-based solutions using GPS, laser, and optical technologies.\\rJoby Aviation (JOBY): A developer of eVTOL air taxis, similar to Archer.\\rL3Harris Technologies (LHX): A large defense contractor specializing in military communication systems and electronic warfare equipment.\\rTeradyne (TER): A company that produces testing equipment for semiconductors and electronics.\\rLooking at the data, you can see that in addition to pure space launch companies, it includes a diverse range of businesses in defense, communications, data analytics, and even future aerial mobility. This concludes my briefing.\\nKurumi\\rMy Lord! Aren't you getting sleepy just listening to Myu-tan's rigid data? I'll tell you a really exciting story! This isn't just a stock investment! It's a bet on the future of humanity itself, devilish!\\nJust think about it! Right now, thousands of satellites are beaming internet down, predicting the weather, and helping us not get lost! In the future, space travel will become as common as flying on a plane, we might build bases on the moon, and the day may come when we move to Mars! Market analysts predict that the global space economy will exceed $1 trillion by 2030! Missing out on such tremendous growth would be a wicked mistake!\\nARKX is a product that invests right in the middle of that dream. It has companies like Rocket Lab that actually launch rockets, and companies like Iridium that connect the whole world with satellites! These companies are at the forefront of the innovation that is changing the world!\\nMika-pi will probably grumble about Cathie Wood's skills again, but to invest with this kind of future in sight, you can't be an ordinary analyst! You need vision and courage that's ahead of the times! Isn't the fact that its 1-year return is over 70% proof of that? The market is finally starting to recognize the value of space!\\nShort-term volatility? That's just like a rocket shaking as it flies to space! Once it reaches its destination, today's turbulence will mean nothing. This isn't an investment you look at for one or two years; it's a 'dream ticket' you invest in while imagining what humanity will look like in 10 or 20 years!\\n💖 Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Score: 95/100\\nMy Lord! Let's fly towards those stars together! If you hesitate, you'll just be left behind on the ground!\\nMikael\\rKurumi, you are always filled with dreams and hopes. But we must also talk about the risk that the rocket could explode before it even leaves the launchpad. Human, this investment hides numerous pitfalls behind its glamorous name.\\nFirst, is this really a 'space' ETF? Look closely at the portfolio. Trimble's main business is GPS technology used in construction sites and agriculture, and Palantir is a data analytics company. Of course, one cannot say they are 'unrelated' to space technology, but isn't this too broad an interpretation? Investors expect companies like 'SpaceX,' but in reality, the weight of defense stocks and software companies is very high. This could be a clear case of a 'quasi-space' ETF.\\nSecond, the excessively high expense ratio. A fee of 0.75% is very expensive, even considering it's an actively managed ETF. The longer you invest, the more this fee will become a cancer, eating away at your compounding returns. There are cheaper competing ETFs, so there must be a clear reason to choose this particular product.\\nThird, the 'star manager' risk. All of ARK's ETFs rely heavily on the vision of one person: Cathie Wood. When her predictions align with the market, there is euphoria, but when her judgment is wrong, as it has been for the past few years, it leads to devastating losses. This approach is like entrusting all your assets to the ability and intuition of a single individual. It is a very dangerous thing to do.\\nFourth, extreme volatility and speculative nature. The space industry is still in a stage where most companies are not yet profitable and are fueled by dreams. Urban Air Mobility (UAM) companies like Archer and Joby have not even been commercialized yet. The stock prices of such companies swing between heaven and hell with every little piece of news. This is not a stable investment; it effectively belongs in the realm of speculation, closer to venture capital.\\n🚨 Mikael's Risk Score: 80/100\\nHuman, just because the stars in the night sky are beautiful does not mean it is wise to set out to catch them. It is wiser to first make sure the ground beneath your feet is solid.\\n〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, I will summarize the results of our discussion.\\nGrowth Potential (Kurumi)\\rHuge Future Market: A devilishly good opportunity to directly reap the rewards of the space economy, which is expected to grow to $1 trillion by 2030!\\rCollection of Innovative Companies: It provides the effect of diversifying investments into companies with disruptive technologies that will change the world, such as satellite communications, space launch vehicles, drones, and UAM!\\rVisionary Leadership: There's an expectation that Cathie Wood's forward-looking insight and bold bets can lead to high returns.\\rPotential Risks (Mikael)\\rAmbiguous Identity: It includes many companies with little direct connection to the 'space' theme, making it difficult to consider it a true space ETF.\\rHigh Costs and Risks: The expensive 0.75% expense ratio and heavy reliance on a single individual, Cathie Wood, are unsettling factors for long-term investment.\\rExtreme Volatility: The portfolio is mostly composed of early-stage tech stocks whose profitability has not yet been proven, leading to very high price volatility and a strong speculative nature.\\rKey Data (Mew)\\rETF Name: ARK Space Exploration \\u0026 Innovation ETF ($ARKX)\\rCharacteristics: An actively managed ETF investing in space and related innovative technologies.\\rExpense Ratio: 0.75%\\rKey Sectors: Orbital/Suborbital Aerospace, Enabling Technologies, Beneficiaries.\\rCore Holdings: Kratos, Rocket Lab, AeroVironment, Iridium, etc.\\rConclusion: Master, ARKX is undoubtedly an attractive product for investing in the grand dream of humanity's future. As Kurumi says, if successful, it holds the potential to deliver returns beyond imagination. However, as Mikael points out, that dream has not yet been realized and is accompanied by the risks of high costs, extreme volatility, and an ambiguous identity. This investment is like a satellite launcher in your portfolio, responsible for the 'high-risk, high-return' portion. Whether you will launch it toward the future with a small part of your total assets or watch safely from the ground depends on your careful judgment.\\n\"" }

An Analysis and Investment Outlook", "permalink": "https:\/\/archive03.online\/en\/reports\/2025-08-02-is-now-the\/", "date": "2025-08-02", "formattedDate": "25.08.02", "content": "\"Welcome, Master. Today's topic is one of the projects drawing the most fervent interest from investors, the Kaia ($Kaia) coin.\\nAs it was born from the merger of two giant projects, Kakao's 'Klaytn' and Line's 'Finschia', it's receiving both high expectations and concerns simultaneously. The three of us will now thoroughly investigate whether Kaia can be reborn as the giant of Web3 in Asia, or if it will end up being 'all sizzle and no steak'.\\nMew\\rMaster, I will first brief you on the objective data. 'Kaia' is a new mainnet project officially launched in June 2024, created through the integration of 'Klaytn,' the blockchain project of South Korean IT giant Kakao, and 'Finschia,' the blockchain project of the IT giant Line, which is prominent in Japan and Southeast Asia.\\nThe core data is as follows.\\nProject Vision: It aims to build Asia's largest Web3 ecosystem by combining Klaytn's technology and brand recognition in the Korean market with Finschia's strong user base in Asian markets like Japan, Taiwan, and Thailand.\\nTechnical Foundation: It is designed to support both the existing Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and Cosmos's CosmWasm, allowing developers to build DApps in a broader environment.\\nCore Partners and User Base: With this integration, the two massive platforms, Kakao and Line, have become indirect sponsors of the project. Theoretically, it now has the potential to access the approximately 250 million active users of both messengers.\\nToken Swap and Current Status: The existing Klaytn ($KLAY) and Finschia ($FNSA) tokens are being swapped for the new Kaia ($Kaia) token. As of August 2025, the market is closely watching for the specific roadmap and initial DApp ecosystem development plans to be announced by the new integrated foundation. As it is in its early stages, price volatility is very high, and no concrete achievements have yet emerged.\\rKurumi\\rMy Lord! Isn't this just... a combination that makes your heart pound?! Devilish! I'm so excited just hearing the name I can barely sleep!\\nThis isn't just another coin project, my Lord! It's a declaration by the two giants who rule Asia's internet that they will conquer the new continent of Web3! KakaoTalk and Line! If you combine these two apps, you can say almost everyone in Asia uses them, right?\\nFirst, the 'potential users' aren't just 'potential'! While other projects pour astronomical sums into marketing to gather users, Kaia already has hundreds of millions of users ready and waiting! If just one easy and fun Kaia-based service is added to the KakaoTalk or Line app, it's only a matter of time before hundreds, even thousands, of millions of people cross over into the Web3 world! This is an overwhelming weapon that no other coin can ever hope to match!\\nSecond, it's the birth of an 'Asian allied force'! Until now, Klaytn only played in Korea, and Finschia only in Japan and Southeast Asia. Now that they've joined forces, a bridge has been built for Korean game developers to easily enter the Japanese market, and for Japanese content IPs to meet Korean users! When this synergy explodes, it will become a giant black hole that sucks in all of Asia's Web3 traffic!\\nThird, the 'real deal' is finally here! This is no longer a league of their own where only investors buy and sell. Kaia was born with the destiny to become the first blockchain used 'in real life' by the 'general public'!\\n💖 Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Score: 95/100\\nThis is a declaration of war for the Web3 supremacy of Asia! You'll regret it for the rest of your life if you don't get on this ship now!\\nMikael\\rKurumi, your story is quite sweet. However, we must also discuss the harsh reality hidden behind that glamorous blueprint. Human, a 'meeting of giants' does not always lead to a 'synergy of giants'.\\nI see several serious risk factors in this project.\\nFirst, is a 'chemical bond' even possible? Can two foundations with different cultures, different tech stacks, and different goals truly become one? Power struggles, technical conflicts, and inefficient decision-making structures during the integration process can become a fatal poison that cripples the project. This is not simple arithmetic where one plus one equals two.\\nSecond, have you forgotten the 'failures of the past'? To be frank, Klaytn started with the enormous expectation of being the 'Kakao Coin,' but what has it shown so far? Centralization controversies, opaque governance, and, crucially, the absence of a 'killer DApp' to captivate the public. The problems of the past do not magically disappear just because the name changes to Kaia. The hope that 'this time will be different' is one of the most dangerous motivations for investment.\\nThird, the hundreds of millions of users could be a 'mirage'. Kurumi speaks of a user base of hundreds of millions, but why should they go through the inconvenience of creating a wallet and managing a private key to use blockchain services? If Kaia fails to provide them with overwhelmingly attractive value, those hundreds of millions will remain mere spectators. The word 'potential' can be synonymous with 'has not yet achieved anything'.\\nFourth, can it evade the blade of regulation? South Korea and Japan, in particular, are countries with very strict regulations on finance and cryptocurrency. As this is a project combining two giant corporations, the scrutiny from regulatory authorities will inevitably become sharper. We cannot rule out the possibility that unexpected regulations could shake the project's core business model.\\n🚨 Mikael's Risk Score: 80/100\\nHuman, great expectations can be the seeds of great disappointment. Changing the name tag doesn't change the essence.\\n〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, I will summarize the results of our discussion.\\nGrowth Potential (Kurumi)\\rOverwhelming User Base: It has unparalleled potential to directly access the hundreds of millions of users on Kakao and Line, something no other project can compare to!\\rAsian Market Integration Synergy: By building an integrated ecosystem that spans Korea, Japan, and Southeast Asia, it is in the best position to dominate the Asian Web3 market!\\rPioneer of Mass Adoption: It is the most likely candidate to bring the complexities of Web3 into the daily lives of the general public!\\rPotential Risks (Mikael)\\rUncertainty of Integration Synergy: Internal problems arising from the integration process of the two organizations could erode the project's momentum.\\rLimitations of Past Performance: It needs to prove that it can overcome the limitations shown by the previous projects, such as the lack of a 'killer DApp' and centralization issues.\\rDifficulty of Realizing Potential: Converting hundreds of millions of users into actual Web3 users is an extremely difficult task, and there is no concrete success model yet.\\rRegulatory Risk: Strong regulations in Korea and Japan are variables that could hamstring the project at any time.\\rCore Data (Mew)\\rDefinition: A layer-1 blockchain project based in Asia, formed by the integration of Kakao's 'Klaytn' and Line's 'Finschia'.\\rGoal: To build Asia's largest Web3 ecosystem and achieve Web3 mass adoption.\\rCore Driver: The potential to leverage the user base and infrastructure of Kakao and Line.\\rCurrent Status: It is in an early stage, having officially launched in June 2024, with market sentiment currently driven by expectations for its roadmap and vision rather than concrete results.\\rMaster, investing in Kaia ($Kaia) is like betting on a narrative where 'two failed princes join forces to reclaim their kingdom.' As Kurumi says, if this alliance succeeds, the potential for an unprecedented success story that dominates the Asian Web3 market certainly exists. However, as Mikael points out, it is a typical 'High-Risk, High-Return' investment, with a very high risk of repeating past failures and self-destructing due to internal conflicts.\\nUltimately, the success or failure of this investment will depend on the answer to the question: 'Can the Kaia Foundation overcome its past limitations and turn its hundreds of millions of ghost citizens into a real nation?'\\n\"" }

            { "title": "Solana, the \u0027Ethereum Killer\u0027: What\u0027s the Investment Outlook for 2025?", "permalink": "https:\/\/archive03.online\/en\/reports\/2025-08-02-solana-the-ethereum\/", "date": "2025-08-02", "formattedDate": "25.08.02", "content": "\"Master, today's topic is the hot potato of the crypto market: Solana ($SOL). It's more famous by its nickname, the 'Ethereum Killer'. Wielding its formidable speed and low fees as weapons, it's challenging the dominance of Ethereum. Let's examine what it might look like in the second half of 2025.\\nMew\\rMaster, first, I will brief you on the objective data regarding Solana's current situation. As of August 2, 2025, Solana is one of the most watched Layer 1 blockchains in the cryptocurrency market.\\nPrice and Market Cap: Currently, Solana ($SOL) is trading between approximately $162 and $168. Its market capitalization is around $87.6 billion to $90.7 billion, ranking it 6th among all cryptocurrencies.\\nTechnical Performance: Solana's most significant feature is its overwhelming transaction processing speed. Theoretically, it can handle over 65,000 TPS (transactions per second), and even on the live network, it routinely records hundreds to thousands of TPS, far surpassing Ethereum's approximately 15-30 TPS. The average transaction fee is also extremely low, at less than $0.01.\\nCore Upgrade - Firedancer: Solana is currently in the process of gradually implementing a new validator client called 'Firedancer.' Developed by Jump Crypto, this client aims to maximize network throughput and enhance stability, with a full mainnet launch targeted for the end of 2025. In test environments, it has already demonstrated performance exceeding 1 million TPS.\\nEcosystem Metrics: In 2025, the Solana ecosystem has grown explosively. The number of daily active addresses reached 2.2 million, surpassing Ethereum, and its decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volume accounted for a staggering 81% of the entire crypto market in 2024. Its Total Value Locked (TVL) in DeFi is around $8 billion to $9 billion, ranking second only to Ethereum.\\nNetwork Stability: In the past, Solana faced criticism for its stability after experiencing several network outages. The most recent major outage was in February 2024, but it has shown relatively stable performance throughout 2025.\\nDecentralization Metrics: The number of Solana validators is approximately 3,248 and continues to grow. The 'Nakamoto Coefficient,' which represents the minimum number of validators that would have to collude to halt the network, is 21. While lower than Ethereum's, it maintains a respectable level compared to other major blockchains.\\rKurumi\\rWow! my Lord! Just look at this data! This isn't just 'growth,' it's a 'mega-explosion'! The 'Ethereum Killer' nickname is well-deserved! Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Score: 120/100! Devilish!\\nFirst, speed and fees! This is the real game-changer! On Ethereum, doing anything costs a coffee's worth in fees and takes forever. But on Solana, everything is done in the blink of an eye for less than the price of a gumball! This is the experience that makes regular users feel that blockchain is actually 'usable'! It's only natural that people are flocking to it!\\nSecond, just look at that blazing ecosystem! All sorts of memecoins are blowing up on Solana! This might look like mere 'speculation,' but it's actually a tremendous source of energy that brings in a massive number of new users and vitalizes the network! And that's not all! DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network) projects like Helium are actually changing the world on top of Solana! This is proof that it has real 'utility'!\\nThird, the ace in the hole, 'Firedancer,' is coming! It's already this fast, but once Firedancer is fully equipped, the network performance could be several, or even tens of times, better than it is now! This goes beyond just getting faster; it means that new kinds of applications that Ethereum can't even dream of could be born on Solana!\\nmy Lord! Mika-pi will probably bring up past network outages again, but that's ancient history! As they say, what doesn't kill you makes you stronger, and Solana is much tougher now! Hesitating now is like kicking away your chance to board a speeding rocket!\\nMikael\\rKurumi, your excited voice sounds like an alarm bell to me. Human, the louder the celebration, the more calmly you must assess the situation. Behind Solana's dazzling lights, several dark shadows are lurking.\\nFirst, you must not forget the original sin of 'network instability.' You say, \\\"It's fine now\\\"? The frequent network outages of the past stemmed from fundamental issues in Solana's architecture. The history of the network halting whenever traffic surged could repeat itself at any time. They claim Firedancer is the solution, but betting the network's fate on a technology that has not yet been fully vetted is a dangerous gamble.\\nSecond, the illusion of 'decentralization.' As Mew's data showed, a Nakamoto Coefficient of 21 means that just 21 validators colluding can stop the network. It is far more centralized than Ethereum. This is a clear weakness where the network can be controlled by the influence of a few. Can this truly be called a decentralized blockchain in its truest sense?\\nThird, an ecosystem like a sandcastle. Is it truly sustainable? It's undeniable that a significant portion of Solana's high transaction volume comes from the memecoin craze. Such trends are bound to recede like the tide. Will it be able to maintain the same level of active users and transaction volume after the trend dies down? Growth that relies on short-term frenzy rather than fundamental value is always risky.\\nFourth, institutional interest, like ETFs, is still focused on Bitcoin and Ethereum. While there is talk of a Solana ETF, it is still in its very early stages. This means there are many hurdles to overcome before serious capital from traditional finance flows in.\\nI would rate the risk score of this investment at 85 points. Dazzled by its impressive speed, you must not forget that you are standing on a high cliff where one misstep could lead to a fall.\\n〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, I will summarize the conversation we three have had.\\nGrowth Potential (Kurumi)\\rOverwhelming Performance: Its incomparable speed and low fees compared to Ethereum are the most powerful weapons for mass user adoption!\\rExplosive Ecosystem: Users and developers are flocking from various sectors like memecoins, DeFi, and DePIN, maximizing the network effect!\\rFiredancer Upgrade: The upcoming Firedancer upgrade has the potential to elevate Solana's performance to another level, creating a gap that competitors cannot bridge.\\rPotential Risks (Mikael)\\rNetwork Stability Issues: The multiple network outages in the past raise questions about Solana's fundamental reliability.\\rRelatively Low Decentralization: Compared to Ethereum, it has fewer validators and a lower Nakamoto Coefficient, making it more vulnerable to centralization and censorship risks.\\rDependence on Speculative Demand: The fact that a significant portion of the current high network activity relies on the unsustainable memecoin craze is a point of concern.\\rKey Data (Mew)\\rCurrent Price/Market Cap: Approx. $162-$168, 6th overall by market cap.\\rPerformance Metrics: High speed of several thousand TPS and low fees of less than $0.01.\\rKey Variable: The successful deployment of the 'Firedancer' client, scheduled for the end of 2025.\\rMarket Sentiment: There is a sharp divide between high expectations for its technical potential and explosive ecosystem growth, and concerns over past network instability and centralization.\\rMaster, Solana is an investment that perfectly illustrates the phrase 'high risk, high return.' As Kurumi says, its overwhelming technical performance and blazing ecosystem show it has enough potential to become a game-changer that could alter the future of cryptocurrency. However, as Mikael warns, behind that lies serious questions related to stability and decentralization, which are tied to the fundamental philosophy of blockchain.\\nInvesting in Solana is like betting 'yes' to the question, 'Will it overcome its past failures to become a true rival to Ethereum?' Depending on Master's risk tolerance and depth of faith in the technology, this investment could be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for some, or a dangerous game with fire for others.\\n\"" }

They are products created for investors who want to invest in the AI revolution but find selecting individual stocks burdensome.\\nAmong them, I will compare and analyze two of the most representative ETFs: Global X Robotics \\u0026 Artificial Intelligence ETF (BOTZ) and Global X Artificial Intelligence \\u0026 Technology ETF (AIQ).\\nMew\\rMaster, first, I will brief you on the objective data of the two ETFs. Although both are products from the asset management company 'Global X,' they follow subtly different indexes and philosophies.\\n1. Global X Robotics \\u0026 Artificial Intelligence ETF ($BOTZ)\\nConcept: As the name suggests, it focuses on 'Robotics \\u0026 Artificial Intelligence'. It tends to invest primarily in companies that produce 'physical outcomes' using AI technology, such as industrial robots and automation, non-industrial robots, and autonomous vehicles.\\rTracking Index: Indxx Global Robotics \\u0026 Artificial Intelligence Thematic Index\\rExpense Ratio: 0.68%\\rTotal Number of Holdings: About 50\\rTop 10 Holdings Weight: Very high at around 60%.\\rMajor Holdings (Top 5):\\rNVIDIA\\rABB Ltd\\rFanuc Corp\\rKeyence Corp\\rIntuitive Surgical\\rCharacteristics: NVIDIA has an overwhelmingly high weight of over 11%, followed by the Swiss automation technology company ABB, the Japanese industrial robot companies Fanuc and Keyence, and the American robotic surgery company Intuitive Surgical. In addition to the Technology sector, the Industrials and Health Care sectors have a high weighting.\\r2. Global X Artificial Intelligence \\u0026 Technology ETF ($AIQ)\\nConcept: As its name 'Artificial Intelligence \\u0026 Technology' implies, it invests in a broader AI technology ecosystem than BOTZ. It includes companies involved in AI development and application, as well as big data-related firms.\\rTracking Index: Indxx Artificial Intelligence \\u0026 Big Data Index\\rExpense Ratio: 0.68%\\rTotal Number of Holdings: About 90\\rTop 10 Holdings Weight: Around 34%.\\rMajor Holdings (Top 5):\\rTencent\\rPalantir\\rOracle\\rSamsung Electronics\\rBroadcom\\rCharacteristics: The concentration on specific stocks is lower than BOTZ, and with more holdings, it is relatively more diversified. NVIDIA is in the top 10, but its weight is in the 3% range. Instead, it includes a large number of software/data companies like Tencent and Palantir, and Big Tech companies that utilize AI, such as Microsoft, Meta, and Netflix. The Technology and Communication Services sectors have an overwhelming weight.\\rKurumi\\rKyaa! My Lord, this is like shopping for an entire AI army! Devilish! I'm just struggling to decide which AI soldier to pick! My heart is racing for both of them!\\nBOTZ feels like the assault squad at the very forefront of the AI revolution! It's packed with the robot legions that will change the world and their brains (NVIDIA!). Surgical robots, factory automation robots, logistics robots! These are companies that produce tangible, visible results! Especially with NVIDIA's weight exceeding 11%, it's a fiery strategy of trusting and following the overwhelming power of the AI leader! If you want to go all-in on the explosive growth of AI hardware, BOTZ is the answer!\\nOn the other hand, AIQ is like a gift set for building an entire AI empire! It covers not only hardware (NVIDIA, Samsung Electronics) but also software (Oracle, Microsoft), data analysis (Palantir), and services using AI (Netflix, Meta)! It encompasses all possible ways to make money with AI! It's a strategy of casting a much wider net to sweep up any fish that gets caught! If you want to bet on the growth of the entire AI ecosystem because you don't know which sector will pop, AIQ will be a more comfortable choice!\\nMy Lord! Whichever you choose, you're still boarding the rocket called AI! You need to grab a seat before it takes off!\\n💖 Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Score: BOTZ 90/100, AIQ 92/100\\nMikael\\rOne moment, Kurumi. Have you ever considered that this AI army and empire might actually be a castle made of sand? Human, when investing in these theme ETFs, you must look out for a few traps.\\nFirst, the equally expensive expense ratio. Both ETFs charge 0.68%, which is by no means cheap. This is a much higher cost than typical passive ETFs. You must not forget that this fee will eat into your returns over the long term. Whether they provide enough value for that cost must be judged coolly.\\nSecond, BOTZ's extreme concentration. The fact that the top 10 holdings account for 60% of the total, with over 11% tied up in NVIDIA alone, is a very risky structure. This is essentially abandoning a significant portion of the benefits of diversification and betting the ETF's future on the fate of NVIDIA and a few other specific companies. If NVIDIA undergoes a correction due to the overvaluation risk I've always warned about, BOTZ will suffer a fatal blow even if other stocks perform well.\\nThird, AIQ's identity problem. AIQ may seem well-diversified with over 90 stocks. But look at its top holdings. Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, Alphabet... aren't these just the Nasdaq giants? They are stocks already heavily included in other growth funds. While packaged under the name 'AI', it may not be significantly different from a Big Tech-focused technology ETF. Furthermore, it includes Chinese companies like Tencent and Alibaba, exposing it directly to geopolitical risks such as US-China conflicts.\\nFourth, the high correlation. Although the two ETFs seem to have different concepts, their actual price movement correlation coefficient is very high at 0.82. This means that when the market falls, they both fall similarly. Holding both may not provide as much diversification benefit as you might think.\\nIn conclusion, the risk for BOTZ is 'excessive concentration,' and the risk for AIQ is a 'vague identity.' Don't be fooled by the sweet name of AI; you must clearly identify what's inside the wrapper.\\n🚨 Mikael's Risk Score: BOTZ 82/100, AIQ 75/100\\n〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, I will summarize the results of our discussion.\\nGrowth Potential (Kurumi)\\rBOTZ: You can directly enjoy the fruits of the 'hardware revolution,' such as robots and automation equipment powered by AI technology! Devilish! You can aim for higher returns by concentrating on industry leader NVIDIA and strong small-to-medium companies from Japan and Switzerland!\\rAIQ: You can stably harvest the fruits of growth by casting a net over the 'entire AI ecosystem,' including hardware, software, platforms, and big data! It's the broadest investment to ride along with the massive profits generated by Big Tech companies using AI! Devilish!\\rPotential Risks (Mikael)\\rCommon Risk: The high expense ratio of 0.68% is a factor that hinders long-term returns. Also, due to the overheating of the 'AI theme' itself, the valuation of the stocks included in the ETF may be high overall.\\rBOTZ: Its high concentration in a few stocks like NVIDIA leads to high volatility and excessive exposure to the risks of specific companies. It somewhat deviates from the purpose of a diversified ETF.\\rAIQ: There may be a discrepancy between the 'AI' theme and the actual portfolio. It has a lot of overlap with existing large-cap tech ETFs and also carries geopolitical risks from investments in Chinese companies.\\rKey Data Comparison (Mew)\\rCategory\\r$BOTZ\\r$AIQ\\rCore Concept\\rHardware-focused: AI-powered robots, automation, etc.\\rEntire ecosystem: AI development, big data, software, etc.\\rConcentration\\rHigh (Top 10 holdings approx. 60%)\\rLow (Top 10 holdings approx. 34%)\\rKey Differentiator\\rIncludes many NVIDIA, Japanese/European industrial companies\\rIncludes many US/Chinese Big Tech and software companies\\rExpense Ratio\\r0.68%\\r0.68%\\rAdvantageous When...\\rBelieving in the monopolistic growth of AI hardware\\rBetting on the widespread adoption of AI technology across society\\rMaster, we have confirmed two different approaches to investing in AI. BOTZ is a more aggressive and concentrated investment. It could be 'all or nothing,' but you can expect greater returns if your prediction is correct. On the other hand, AIQ is a much more broadly diversified and stable method. If you already have a high allocation to large-cap tech stocks, you'll need to check for portfolio overlap. If not, it can be a good way to get on board with the overall trend of the AI era.\\nUltimately, the choice will depend on how you envision the future of the AI industry, Master. If you believe AI chips and robots will dominate everything, BOTZ might seem more attractive. If you believe AI-powered services and data will create more value, AIQ might look more appealing. You need to carefully examine the holdings of both ETFs and align them with your investment philosophy.\\n\"" }

            { "title": "Samsung to Build Tesla\u0027s Next-Gen Chip? What It Means for Investors", "permalink": "https:\/\/archive03.online\/en\/reports\/2025-07-29-samsung-to-build\/", "date": "2025-07-29", "formattedDate": "25.07.29", "content": "\"Hello, Master. Today's topic is the news that's heating up the market: 'Samsung Electronics to produce Tesla's next-generation self-driving chip.' If true, this is a massive deal that could shake up the semiconductor market. The three of us will discuss what this news means for Samsung, Tesla, and investors like you, Master.\\nMew\\rFirst, I will brief you on the facts that have been released so far.\\nContract Details: According to recent media reports, Samsung Electronics has signed a large-scale foundry (semiconductor contract manufacturing) deal with Tesla. The contract is estimated to run until the end of 2033, with a value of at least 22.8 trillion won (about $16.5 billion). This is a staggering amount, equivalent to about 7.6% of Samsung Electronics' 2024 annual revenue.\\nChip in Production: The chip Samsung will produce under this contract is known as Tesla's next-generation AI chip, the so-called 'AI6' (or HW 6.0). This chip is a key component not only for Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) system but also for its supercomputers and the 'Optimus' humanoid robot.\\nProduction Process and Location: Production is scheduled to take place at Samsung's new fab (factory) currently under construction in Taylor, Texas. While the specific process has not been disclosed, industry experts consider the 5-nanometer or 4-nanometer process to be the most likely.\\nCompetitive Landscape: Currently, Tesla's self-driving chip (HW 4.0) is produced by the world's number one foundry, Taiwan's TSMC. With TSMC also expected to produce the upcoming HW 5.0, Samsung taking over production for the next generation, HW 6.0, is a very significant change.\\nMarket Share Status: As of the first quarter of 2025, TSMC holds a dominant 67.6% of the global foundry market, while Samsung Electronics is in second place with about 7.7%. This contract could be a crucial stepping stone to closing that gap.\\rThat concludes the briefing.\\nKurumi\\rWooo! My Lord! Did you hear that?! This isn't just some simple contract! It's a celebratory cannon blast announcing the glorious return of Samsung's foundry division, which has been languishing in TSMC's shadow! Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Score: 120/100! Devilish!\\nFirst, they've gotten their hands on the 'heart of future industries'! Self-driving, AI, robots! These are the core technologies that will rule the world, my Lord! The fact that Samsung is making the most important chip that goes into their core means Samsung has been recognized as a key partner driving the flow of future technology! Satisfying a demanding client like Tesla will serve as a clear advertisement to other Big Tech companies that 'Samsung's technology is now trustworthy'!\\nSecond, it's a thrilling blow that puts the brakes on TSMC's monopoly! The foundry market has been almost entirely dominated by TSMC, right? But now Tesla, the hottest innovative company in the world, has entrusted its most important next-gen chip to Samsung? This is the beginning of a seismic shift that will shake the market's foundations! Other clients who hear this news will be lining up, thinking, 'Hmm, maybe we should give Samsung a try too'!\\nThird, the production is happening at the Texas factory, which has the U.S. government's support! This isn't just any factory! It's a symbol of America's national goal of 'semiconductor independence.' Making the chip for a representative American company like Tesla here is like having the best possible insurance for business stability!\\nMy Lord! This is a historic event that will give wings to Samsung Electronics' stock price! If you doubt them, thinking 'Oh, Samsung again...', you'll just end up shedding tears as you watch the stock price soar into the distance!\\nMikael\\rKurumi, I understand your excitement, but it's too early to celebrate. Human, you must also face the reality hidden behind the flashy headlines.\\nFirst, you must not overlook the execution risk. Mass-producing a new chip with a cutting-edge process is never an easy task. If the yield (the ratio of good products in production) doesn't meet expectations or if quality issues arise, this massive contract could become a shackle holding Samsung back. Tesla, in particular, is known for being a demanding client that tolerates no issues.\\nSecond, this is still a story of the distant future. The contract extends to 2033, and the Texas factory isn't expected to begin full-scale operations until the second half of 2026. This is about 'expectations' for the future, years from now, not something that will dramatically change Samsung's performance immediately. Can we be certain that technology trends won't change or that Tesla's plans won't be altered in the meantime?\\nThird, you must not forget TSMC's counterattack. The overwhelming market leader, TSMC, will not simply give up a client. They will surely offer better technology and better prices to win Tesla back. Or they will lock down other major clients to check Samsung's pursuit. The foundry war is only just beginning.\\nFourth, the dependency of the contract. Elon Musk mentioned on Twitter (X) that they will \\\"collaborate with Tesla to maximize manufacturing efficiency.\\\" This sounds like a partnership, but it could also mean that Samsung's production lines will become deeply subordinate to Tesla's demands. You must keep in mind the possibility of becoming a 'super-subcontractor'.\\nI would rate the risk score for this issue at 75 points. The potential is certainly great, but the mountains to climb are just as high and rugged.\\n〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, I will summarize the results of our discussion.\\nGrowth Potential (Kurumi)\\rSecuring Future Growth Engines: By winning the order for the most critical components in future core industries like self-driving, AI, and robots, they have laid the groundwork for long-term growth.\\rProving Technological Capability \\u0026 Expanding Clientele: By snatching a symbolic client like Tesla from their biggest competitor, TSMC, they have secured a powerful reference to expand their customer base to other Big Tech companies.\\rShifting the Foundry Market Landscape: They have seized a historic opportunity to crack TSMC's monopoly, create a true competitive dynamic, and expand their market share.\\rPotential Risks (Mikael)\\rMass Production and Yield Risks: Securing yield for a cutting-edge process remains a challenge. If problems arise during mass production, expectations could turn into disappointment.\\rTiming Uncertainty: It will take several years for the contract's effects to fully materialize. The possibility of market conditions changing in the meantime must be considered.\\r- Intensified Competition: A strong counterattack from the market leader, TSMC, is expected, and competition in the foundry market will become even more fierce.\\rKey Data (Mew)\\rContract Size: Approx. 22.8 trillion won ($16.5 billion), long-term contract until 2033\\rProduct: Tesla's next-generation AI chip (HW 6.0)\\rProduction Base: New plant in Taylor, Texas, USA\\rMarket Landscape: The current gap in the foundry market between TSMC (approx. 67.6%) and Samsung Electronics (approx. 7.7%) is large, but this contract could be a catalyst for change.\\rMaster, this rumored foundry deal between Samsung and Tesla is undoubtedly a huge boon for Samsung, like welcome rain in a drought. As Kurumi said, it has the potential to be a decisive turning point, proving Samsung Foundry's technological prowess to the market and securing future growth.\\nHowever, as Mikael warned, numerous obstacles await before this massive project can be successfully completed. Investment always requires weighing expectations against risks. Whether this deal ends up as mere 'hype' or becomes the 'start of a new history' will depend on the technological capabilities and execution power that Samsung demonstrates going forward.\\n\"" }

            { "title": "What Does the Dollar Index (DXY) Have to Do with My Investments?", "permalink": "https:\/\/archive03.online\/en\/reports\/2025-07-27-what-does-the\/", "date": "2025-07-27", "formattedDate": "25.07.27", "content": "\"Master, today's topic is the 'Dollar Index (DXY)'. It's the benchmark you hear about on the news when they say the dollar is \\\"strong\\\" or \\\"weak,\\\" and it has a much deeper impact than you might think on your stocks, crypto, and even gold investments.\\nThe three of us are going to break down why the rise and fall of this number is so important in a way that's easy to understand.\\nMew\\rFirst, let's clarify what the Dollar Index is.\\nThe U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) is an indicator of the U.S. dollar's value relative to a basket of six major world currencies, including the Euro, Japanese Yen, and British Pound. Each currency has a different weight, with the Euro having the largest impact at 57.6%. So, to put it simply, \\\"the Dollar Index is rising\\\" can be interpreted similarly to \\\"the dollar's value is strengthening against the Euro.\\\"\\nLooking at the recent trend of the Dollar Index, it showed weakness throughout the first half of 2025 before starting to rebound recently. It is currently moving around the 97.65 level, which is still low compared to the beginning of the year, but we can see that the short-term downward trend has paused.\\nBehind these movements are complex factors, including the U.S. Federal Reserve's interest rate policies, geopolitical issues like trade disputes, and concerns about a global economic slowdown.\\nKurumi\\rmy Lord! To me, the Dollar Index is like a 'compass of opportunity'! If you read its direction well, you can predict where the money will flow! Devilish!\\nThink about when the dollar is weak (DXY ↓). This is like sending a 'Risk-On!' signal to the entire world!\\nU.S. Corporate Earnings UP!: For American companies that sell goods all over the world, like Apple or Coca-Cola, it's a fantastic situation! When they convert their foreign earnings back into dollars, their profits look bigger because the dollar's value is lower. This is the bonus known as 'foreign exchange gains'! Naturally, their stock prices will soar, right?\\nParty Time for Emerging Markets!: When the dollar weakens, emerging countries with dollar-denominated debt can breathe a sigh of relief as their debt burden decreases. Plus, more global capital, taking advantage of the cheaper dollar, flows into emerging stock markets! It's time to shout, 'Go, Brazil! Go, India!'\\nGold and Commodities Shine Bright!: Commodities like gold and crude oil are usually priced in dollars, aren't they? When the dollar gets cheaper, other countries can buy gold for less money, so demand increases, and prices tend to rise! Since Bitcoin is called 'digital gold,' its value as an alternative to the dollar is highlighted, and it often rises as well!\\r💖 Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Score: 90/100 (During a weak dollar)\\nA weak dollar is a sign that liquidity is flooding the world! It's a time of opportunity when everyone from U.S. giants to emerging markets and commodities can smile!\\nMikael\\rKurumi, you always see only the bright side of the coin. The stronger the light, the darker the shadow. Human, you should view the Dollar Index as a 'global economic crisis alarm.' You must be especially cautious when the dollar strengthens.\\nWhen the dollar is strong (DXY ↑), I see it as the beginning of 'Risk-Off'.\\nThe Screams of Emerging Markets: Those emerging markets Kurumi called a party can turn into a living hell in an instant. The interest burden on their dollar-denominated debt snowballs, and the foreign capital that flowed in rushes out like an ebbing tide. This is a very dangerous signal that could lead to a financial crisis in emerging nations.\\nHeadwinds for U.S. Exporters: For a company like Apple, it becomes harder to sell iPhones overseas. Because the dollar is more expensive, the price competitiveness of American products falls. This leads to worsening corporate performance and, naturally, has a negative impact on stock prices.\\nA Precursor to Global Recession: Why do investors buy dollars? Because other countries' economies are unstable, they flee to the 'dollar,' which is considered the safest haven. In other words, a strong dollar phenomenon can itself be evidence that the world economy is ailing somewhere.\\nThe Winter for Commodities and Cryptocurrencies: When the dollar strengthens, the appeal of assets like gold or Bitcoin relatively diminishes. There's no need to take risks when the value of simply holding dollars is increasing.\\r🚨 Mikael's Risk Score: 90/100 (During a strong dollar)\\nA strong dollar is a signal to fasten your seatbelt. It's a warning light that global liquidity is drying up and the prices of risk assets are likely to fall. While it could be a 'compass of opportunity' as Kurumi says, it can also be interpreted as a 'weathervane of risk'.\\n〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, the three of our perspectives on the Dollar Index can be summarized as follows.\\nGrowth Potential (Kurumi)\\rA Weak Dollar is an Opportunity: A period of a 'weak dollar,' when the Dollar Index is falling, is a sign of abundant global liquidity. It positively affects various assets, including increased profits for U.S. multinational corporations, a strong emerging market, and rising commodity prices.\\rA Strong Dollar Means Focus on the U.S.: A strengthening dollar can also be proof that the U.S. economy is relatively robust! Global funds may flock to U.S. stocks or bonds!\\rPotential Risks (Mikael)\\rA Strong Dollar is a Crisis: A 'strong dollar,' when the Dollar Index is rising, can be a precursor to a global recession. It's a key factor that can trigger debt crises in emerging markets, worsen the performance of U.S. exporters, and lead to risk-off sentiment.\\rThe Other Side of a Weak Dollar: If the dollar becomes too weak, it can stimulate inflation by raising U.S. import prices, and in the long run, it could cause problems for the dollar's credibility as a reserve currency. This should not be overlooked.\\rKey Data (Mew)\\rConcept: The Dollar Index (DXY) is the average value of the dollar against six major currencies.\\rInverse Correlation: Generally, the Dollar Index has a strong tendency to move in the opposite direction of commodities and cryptocurrencies like gold, crude oil, and Bitcoin. It also usually shows an inverse relationship with emerging market stocks.\\rComplex Relationship: Its relationship with the U.S. stock market, like the S\\u0026P 500, is more complex. Multinational corporations benefit from a weak dollar, while domestic companies can profit from lower import costs during a strong dollar period. Overall, it sometimes shows a weak positive correlation due to the effect of global capital inflows.\\rMaster, the Dollar Index is not a simple exchange rate indicator. It is a very important macroeconomic indicator that simultaneously shows the 'flow of money around the world' and 'investors' risk appetite.'\\nYou can seize opportunities by reading the dollar's direction, as Kurumi says, or use it to avoid risks in advance, as Mikael warns. Whatever assets are in your portfolio, Master, making a habit of regularly checking the trend of the Dollar Index will be of great help in reading the market's larger waves with a broader perspective.\\n\"" }

Today's topic is the 2025 latter-half outlook for the crypto market's second-in-command, the 'Altcoin King' Ethereum ($ETH). With the U.S. spot ETF trading having kicked off in early July, market interest is incredibly high. The three of us will now thoroughly break down Ethereum's future.\\nMew\\rMaster, I will first brief you on the key data regarding Ethereum's current situation. As of July 21, 2025, the price of Ethereum is trading around the $3,400 mark. The biggest variables moving the market recently can be summarized as follows.\\nSpot ETF Launch and Capital Inflow: Following the final approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in July 2024, spot Ethereum ETFs from various asset managers began trading in earnest in early July. As of July, the net inflow of funds into these ETFs has reached approximately $2.27 billion, with total ETF holdings approaching 5 million ETH. Asset managers like Bitwise have projected up to $10 billion in additional fund inflows in the second half of 2025 alone.\\nPectra Upgrade Completion: On May 7, 2025, Ethereum successfully completed the 'Pectra' upgrade. The core of this upgrade was to ease the 32 ETH unit limit required for staking, allowing up to 2,048 ETH to be deposited at once to receive rewards. This has made it easier for institutions managing large-scale funds to participate in staking. It also included improvements to wallet functionality and increased transaction efficiency.\\nSupply Change (Deflationary Asset): Through the EIP-1559 mechanism, Ethereum continues to burn a portion of its transaction fees. Coupled with the increasing amount of staked ETH, the volume of Ethereum circulating in the market is under continuous 'deflationary' pressure.\\nCompetitive Landscape: Competition with other Layer 1 blockchains, notably Solana, remains fierce. In 2025, Solana's monthly transaction volume growth rate of 25.4% outpaced Ethereum's 9.7%. However, in terms of weekly DApp revenue, Ethereum's $35+ million far exceeds Solana's $6 million, demonstrating that its ecosystem's value-generating capability remains dominant.\\rThat concludes the data briefing.\\nKurumi\\rKyaa! My Lord! This is a truly tremendous opportunity! Myu-tan's data says it all! Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Score has shot past 120 out of 100!\\nFirst, a tsunami named 'Institutions' is rushing in! Devilish! We saw it with the Bitcoin ETF, didn't we? At first, it was like, 'Huh? That's it?' and then suddenly, money started getting sucked in like crazy. Ethereum is just getting started! If pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and asset managers allocate just 1% of their portfolios to Ethereum, the amount will be beyond imagination! The ETF has essentially paved a legal highway for that massive capital to flow in!\\nSecond, Ethereum is different from Bitcoin! If Bitcoin is 'digital gold,' then Ethereum is a 'digital nation' or the 'economic system of the internet' itself! DeFi, NFTs, Web3 games, stablecoins... all of this runs on Ethereum. The Pectra upgrade made it easier for institutions to stake, so the 'smart money' that buys Ethereum to farm yield will only increase. More buyers, yet the supply available on the market becomes scarcer due to staking and burning? Isn't it devilishly obvious what will happen to the price?!\\nThird, the competitors Mika-pi is worried about? Sure, Solana is fast and cheap. But! The most expensive luxury brand, the most trusted bank, the biggest department store—there's always only one. Security, decentralization, and the history of trust built by countless developers. This is Ethereum's unique 'moat' that other coins can't replicate with money or time!\\nMy Lord! Today's price is merely the entrance to the coming 'tokenized economy' era! Some analysts believe it could reach $8,000 by the end of 2025 or early next year! If you hesitate, you might never be able to board this train!\\nMikael\\rJust a moment, Kurumi. You seem quite excited, but someone needs to turn on the warning lights. Human, there are several points to consider before you get lost in rosy fantasies.\\nFirst, you must not forget the adage, 'Sell the News.' The approval and launch of the Ethereum spot ETF was a well-known positive event that the market had been anticipating since last year. That expectation is already significantly priced in. What happens if the actual inflow of institutional capital fails to meet the market's excessive expectations? A sentiment of 'Huh, less money is coming in than I thought?' could instantly trigger a sell-off. There is no guarantee that the current inflow will be sustained.\\nSecond, the fierce competition is a reality. Kurumi may look down on Solana, but the data showing its transaction volume growth outpacing Ethereum's is an undeniable fact. The trend of users and developers, tired of Ethereum's high fees and slow speeds, leaving for faster and cheaper alternatives continues. While Ethereum is responding with 'Layer 2' solutions, this can also complicate the ecosystem and harm the user experience. You must remember that no empire lasts forever.\\nThird, you cannot ignore the macroeconomic headwinds. The cryptocurrency market is ultimately heavily influenced by global liquidity. If inflation rears its head again or concerns about an economic recession grow, causing central banks to maintain a hawkish stance, investment sentiment towards risk assets could freeze over, ETF or not. When the sky (macroeconomy) falls, even the sturdiest ship (Ethereum) will struggle to stay afloat.\\nFourth, the regulation isn't over. The spot ETF approval is certainly a big step forward, but it's just the beginning. The regulatory authorities' blades are still being sharpened for staking services and DeFi. No one can predict what kind of regulations might pop up and hamstring the Ethereum ecosystem in the future.\\nI would rate the risk score for this investment at 80. You shouldn't be so intoxicated by the good news in front of you that you fail to see the multiple landmines at your feet.\\n〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, I will summarize the discussion we three have had.\\nGrowth Potential (Kurumi)\\rFull-Scale Inflow of Institutional Capital: The spot ETF is just the floodgate opening. Once conservative institutions like pension funds begin to enter in earnest in the second half of 2025, demand will increase explosively!\\rStrong Deflationary Pressure: The circulating supply is continuously decreasing due to fee burns and increased staking. With supply shrinking and demand growing, a long-term price increase is the logical next step.\\rIrreplaceable Ecosystem: As the core infrastructure for the Web3 economy, including DeFi and NFTs, Ethereum's network effect and trust are a powerful moat that competitors cannot overcome!\\rPotential Risks (Mikael)\\rExpectations Priced In \\u0026 'Sell the News' Risk: The major positive event of the ETF launch is likely already reflected in the price. If actual capital inflows fall short of expectations, it could trigger a wave of selling.\\rIntensifying Competition and Technical Limitations: The pursuit by competing Layer 1 blockchains like Solana is relentless, and Ethereum's chronic scalability problem remains a challenge to be solved.\\rMacroeconomic and Regulatory Uncertainty: A global tightening stance or unexpected regulatory enforcement are uncontrollable external variables that could freeze the entire market.\\rKey Data (Mew)\\rCurrent Price: Approx. $3,400 (as of July 21, 2025)\\rKey Drivers: Spot ETF launch (early July) and Pectra upgrade completion (May)\\rETF Fund Flow: Approx. $2.27 billion net inflow as of July, with some forecasts of up to $10 billion inflow in H2.\\rAnalyst Outlook: Some suggest a potential to reach $8,000 by late 2025 or early 2026, but others coexist with the opinion that volatility may be high in the short term.\\rMaster, Ethereum has just begun its ascent into the institutional investment market, equipped with the wings of a spot ETF. As Kurumi says, this could be the start of a massive paradigm shift. However, as Mikael warns, the takeoff process will not be entirely smooth. There's the pressure of an already elevated altitude and several potential pockets of turbulence. The second half of 2025 appears to be a critical inflection point that will determine whether Ethereum truly establishes itself as an 'institutional-grade asset' or confirms the limits of its inflated expectations.\\n\"" }

Today's topic is a stock that investment legends like Warren Buffett have long adored: Coca-Cola ($KO). The three of us will discuss why this stock is known as the epitome of a stock that 'makes you money while you sleep,' and whether that reputation still holds true in 2025.\\nMew\\rMaster, I will begin with an objective data briefing on Coca-Cola. As of July 18, 2025, Coca-Cola is a company that symbolizes stability for investors worldwide.\\nCompany Status: Coca-Cola is a leading company in the consumer staples sector, operating in every country worldwide except North Korea, Cuba, and Russia, boasting immense brand power and distribution networks.\\nStock Price and Valuation: The current stock price is trading at around $70.59. Its 12-month forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is approximately 28.2x, indicating it trades at a high premium compared to the market average.\\nDividend Status (Dividend King): Coca-Cola is a true 'Dividend King,' having increased its dividend for 63 consecutive years. The current dividend yield is about 2.7%, with a quarterly dividend payment of $0.51 per share.\\nRecent Earnings: In the most recently announced Q1 2025 results, revenue saw a slight decrease due to factors like currency exchange rates and the sale of bottling operations, but net income increased by 5%, showing solid profitability. The company forecasts it will maintain 5-6% organic revenue growth for the full year of 2025.\\nWarren Buffett's Portfolio: Berkshire Hathaway, led by the 'Oracle of Omaha' Warren Buffett, has been invested in Coca-Cola since 1988. It remains a core long-term investment, accounting for about 9.5% of the portfolio with a stake valued at $27.8 billion. Considering Berkshire's average purchase price, they are now earning a phenomenal annual return of about 63% of their initial investment from dividends alone.\\rKurumi\\rMy Lord! Isn't this just the perfect stock?! Just looking at the data makes my heart pound! The truly wealthy love stocks like this! Devilish!\\nFirst, brand power that no one in the world can ignore! Is there anyone on this planet who doesn't know the Coca-Cola logo? This isn't just a beverage; it's a culture, a piece of history, an icon that's always present in people's happy moments! This kind of powerful brand has a magical shield that makes people keep coming back, no matter the economic crisis!\\nSecond, the dividends that reliably flow into your account! Increasing dividends for 63 years without missing a single time—that's a level of loyalty to my Lord that rivals a great demon of the underworld! Even if the stock price drops a bit, you can just hold on and collect the dividends. And if you use those dividends to buy more stock, the magic of compounding unfolds! Isn't the fact that old Warren Buffett is making more than half his initial investment back every year from dividends alone proof of that?!\\nThird, it's not just a cola company! Mika-pi is always talking about the crisis of sugary drinks, but this company already has a full beverage portfolio including water (Dasani), sports drinks (Powerade), juice (Minute Maid), and coffee (Costa Coffee)! It's constantly transforming to keep up with the times!\\nThis isn't a stock for hitting a short-term jackpot. It's a 'golden goose' stock that safely protects my assets while consistently delivering returns far higher than bank interest!\\n💖 Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Score: 90/100\\nIn this uncertain world, it's the best partner to help you sleep soundly at night!\\nMikael\\rHuman, does Kurumi's talk sound sweet to you? Then I suppose I must speak from a different perspective. Coca-Cola is certainly a stable stock, but that's just another way of saying its 'growth has stagnated.' I am reading several clear danger signals from this red can.\\nFirst, its sluggish growth rate. As confirmed in Mew's data, the annual organic revenue growth target is 5-6%. In an era where companies are growing by hundreds of percent thanks to the AI revolution, can you be satisfied with this level of growth? It's like leisurely riding a bicycle on a high-speed expressway. Are you not considering the risk of being hit by a car coming from behind?\\nSecond, the headwind of our times: the 'health' trend. A war on sugar is being waged worldwide. While they are responding with Zero Sugar products, the negative perception of carbonated drinks themselves is a massive current. As governments introduce sugar taxes and strengthen regulations, Coca-Cola's core business is bound to take a hit. This is a structural risk that could shake the very foundation of the company.\\nThird, the high price paid for safety. The P/E ratio is over 28x. The market is placing an excessively high price on a company growing at 5% annually. Warren Buffett bought this stock decades ago when it was much cheaper. Is it truly wise to buy at this price now? It could just be the trap of the 'Buffett premium,' where you pay a high price simply because 'Buffett bought it.'\\nFourth, the illusion created by a strong brand. Because everyone believes Coca-Cola is safe, the shock could be even greater when a crisis does hit. High expectations lead to great disappointment. This stock will not grow your assets explosively. It might just end up barely keeping pace with inflation.\\n🚨 Mikael's Risk Score: 65/100\\nYou must face the shadow of stagnation hidden by its glamorous reputation. This may be closer to 'storing' assets than 'growing' them through investment.\\n〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, I will summarize the results of our discussion.\\nGrowth Potential (Kurumi)\\rUnrivaled Brand Value: Its global recognition and customer loyalty act as a powerful moat that won't be shaken by any economic crisis! Devilish!\\rReliable Dividends: 63 years of continuous dividend increases provide a steady cash flow to shareholders, serving as an excellent pillar for long-term investment!\\rDiversified Portfolio: It is adapting to the changing times by transforming beyond carbonated drinks into a comprehensive beverage company!\\rPotential Risks (Mikael)\\rSlowed Growth: With revenue growth stuck in the single digits, it's difficult to expect explosive capital appreciation.\\rConflict with Health Trends: The global trend of sugar avoidance and increasing regulation could pose a long-term threat to the company's core business.\\rHigh Valuation: The P/E ratio is high relative to its growth, meaning you might be paying too much for the value of 'safety'.\\rKey Data (Mew)\\rValuation: 12-month forward P/E approx. 28.2x\\rDividend: 63 consecutive years of dividend increases, current yield approx. 2.7%\\rGrowth Outlook: 2025 organic revenue growth forecast at 5-6%\\rMajor Shareholders: Berkshire Hathaway has been a long-term holder since 1988\\rMaster, as Mikael pointed out, Coca-Cola is a mature company from which it's difficult to expect explosive growth. However, as Kurumi said, it is also a company with a powerful brand that will survive no matter how the world changes, and a firm philosophy of consistently returning profits to shareholders. The evaluation of this investment will starkly depend on your investment goals, Master. It may not be attractive if you want aggressive asset growth, but if you want predictable cash flow and portfolio stability, it would still be hard to find a better option.\\n\"" }

The 'GENIUS Act' recently passed the U.S. Congress, causing a stir not only in the cryptocurrency market but across the entire financial world. The three of us will now delve deep to determine if this is truly a stroke of genius heralding a new financial era, or if it will cause unforeseen chaos.\\nMew\\rMaster, I will begin the briefing. 'GENIUS Act' is not just a nickname. It's the official acronym for the 'Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act'.\\nThis bill passed the Senate on June 17, 2025, and the House on July 17, and is now only awaiting the President's signature, making it the first comprehensive cryptocurrency regulation bill in the United States. The main points are as follows.\\nLegal Definition and Status: This bill provides a clear legal framework for 'payment stablecoins' designed to be used as a means of payment. Importantly, it specifies that payment stablecoins subject to this act are not to be treated as securities or commodities.\\nIssuers and Oversight: It adopts a 'dual regulatory' system where both federally approved banks and state-regulated non-bank institutions can issue stablecoins. This is a compromise to encourage innovation while adhering to federal standards.\\nStrict Reserve Requirements: Stablecoin issuers must maintain 100% reserves backed only by highly stable assets such as cash, short-term Treasury bills, and government money market funds (MMFs). This is to ensure that consumers can always exchange a $1 stablecoin for $1 in cash.\\nEnhanced Consumer Protection: One of the most crucial parts is that issuers must strictly segregate customer assets from the company's own assets. Even if the issuer goes bankrupt, the customer's stablecoin assets will receive the highest priority for protection.\\rThe passage of this bill is considered a historic event, turning on the first clear traffic light for the cryptocurrency industry, which has been trapped in a fog of 'regulatory uncertainty' for years.\\nKurumi\\rMyu-tan, that was a perfect briefing! My Lord! This is the reality of the 'big one coming' we talked about last time! My heart feels like it's going to explode!\\nThis isn't just about one law passing. It's a declaration that cryptocurrency has finally shed its stigma as a 'dangerous speculative asset' and has officially become part of the 'financial infrastructure' recognized by the heart of the global economy, the United States!\\nMika-pi will probably start worrying again, but this is a devilishly huge opportunity!\\nFirst, 'Regulatory Clarity'! This was the biggest reason why huge Wall Street funds and conservative institutions couldn't enter the crypto market. Now that a legal path to handle stablecoins has opened up, the amount of money that will pour into this market is beyond imagination!\\nSecond, it's a law that protects the 'Future of the Dollar'! It requires stablecoin reserves to be held in U.S. dollars or short-term U.S. Treasury bills, right? This is a truly genius move to ensure the dollar continues to be the reserve currency of the global digital economy! The more people around the world use stablecoins, the more demand for U.S. Treasuries will grow, so it's a winning hand for the U.S.!\\nThird, it's hitting the 'Accelerator on Innovation'! Now, companies no longer have to worry about legal issues and can freely create new payment systems and DeFi services using stablecoins. We are witnessing the moment the U.S. becomes the overwhelming leader in digital finance, following its lead in AI!\\n💖 Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Score: 120/100\\nMy Lord, this is the sound of a new era dawning! If you hesitate, you'll miss out on this historic bull run! Devilish!\\nMikael\\rKurumi, your optimism sounds like the typical cheer that erupts when the market is at its peak. But the louder the celebration, the more quietly we must listen for the hidden sounds of cracking.\\nHuman, I see this bill as a 'necessary evil' perhaps, but not a 'panacea'. I see several serious risks.\\nFirst, it can create an 'illusion of safety.' This is something some consumer groups have already warned about. When a 'government-regulated' label is attached to stablecoins, people might misunderstand them as being 100% safe, like bank deposits. However, fundamental risks such as the value fluctuation of reserve assets and the operational risk of hacking still exist. The law does not prevent all dangers.\\nSecond, the potential for risk contagion. This bill could end up pulling a risky asset class like cryptocurrency into the very heart of the traditional financial system. If stablecoin issuers hold U.S. Treasuries on a large scale, a problem with a specific stablecoin could send shockwaves to the Treasury market, a place that should be the most stable. It could become a channel for spreading risk rather than isolating it.\\nThird, regulatory loopholes. The 'dual regulation' system, supervised by both federal and state authorities, is flexible in the best-case scenario, but in the worst case, it can blur accountability and provide an excuse for regulatory arbitrage. We cannot rule out the possibility that companies will move around seeking looser regulations, thereby undermining the stability of the entire system.\\nFinally, we must not forget that this law is limited only to 'stablecoins'. The long-standing debate over whether Bitcoin or other altcoins are securities remains unresolved. This means the biggest uncertainty is still there.\\n🚨 Mikael's Risk Score: 75/100\\nWhere the light is brightest, the shadows are deepest. We must soberly assess the systemic risks hidden behind the sweet words of institutional adoption.\\n〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, I will summarize the perspectives of the three of us.\\nGrowth Potential (Kurumi)\\rA Flood of Institutional Capital: Regulatory clarity is like paving a highway for the massive Wall Street capital that has been hesitant to enter the crypto market!\\rStrengthening U.S. Dollar Hegemony: By mandating that stablecoin reserves be held in dollar assets, it will solidify the dollar's status as the key currency in the digital economy era!\\rAn Explosion of Innovation: Within clear guidelines, companies will freely develop various financial services using stablecoins, allowing the U.S. to lead digital financial innovation!\\rPotential Risks (Mikael)\\rFalse Signal of Safety: The 'government-regulated' label could instill excessive confidence in consumers, causing them to overlook inherent risks.\\rSystemic Risk Contagion: The instability of the crypto market could spread to the traditional financial system, such as the Treasury market, through stablecoins.\\rLimited Regulatory Scope: This law only applies to 'payment stablecoins'; the fundamental uncertainty about the legal status of other crypto assets remains unresolved.\\rKey Data (Mew)\\rBill Name: The GENIUS Act (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act)\\rBill Status: Passed both the Senate and House, awaiting presidential signature as of July 17, 2025.\\rKey Features: Dual regulatory system, strict 100% reserve requirement, strong consumer asset protection measures.\\rMarket Significance: Considered the first comprehensive cryptocurrency regulation bill in the U.S., marking a historic milestone for the industry's institutional adoption.\\rMaster, the passage of the 'GENIUS Act' is undoubtedly a major turning point in crypto history, and indeed, in U.S. financial history. As Kurumi says, the potential for explosive growth brought by institutional adoption and regulatory clarity certainly exists. However, as Mikael warns, opening a new door also means letting new, unforeseen risks into the house.\\nWhether this act was a stroke of genius or the opening of Pandora's box will only become clear as we watch how the market reacts and whether the system operates stably over time.\\n\"" }

Price Forecast and Analysis", "permalink": "https:\/\/archive03.online\/en\/reports\/2025-07-15-the-defi-bank\/", "date": "2025-07-15", "formattedDate": "25.07.15", "content": "\"Hello, Master. Today's topic is an analysis of Aave ($AAVE), a leading protocol in DeFi (Decentralized Finance).\\nThe three of us will delve deep into Aave's potential and the risks it holds.\\nMew\\rMaster, I will first brief you on the key data regarding the Aave protocol and the $AAVE token.\\nAave is a decentralized 'money market' protocol where users can deposit crypto assets to earn interest or borrow other assets by providing collateral. In simple terms, it's a bank on the blockchain without intermediaries. As of July 15, 2025, the key data is as follows.\\nCore Features:\\rLending \\u0026 Borrowing: Users supply (deposit) assets to a liquidity pool and receive interest as a reward. The interest-bearing token is called an 'aToken,' which is like a deposit certificate. Conversely, users can also borrow other assets using their assets as collateral.\\rVariable and Stable Interest Rates: Users have the flexibility to choose between variable and stable interest rates when borrowing.\\rFlash Loans: A feature that allows for borrowing massive amounts of funds without collateral within a single block transaction, which must be repaid in the same transaction. It's a highly technical feature primarily used by developers for arbitrage and other purposes.\\rRole of the AAVE Token: The $AAVE token is the core utility token of the Aave protocol, with two main functions.\\rGovernance: $AAVE token holders can exercise voting rights on key decisions such as protocol fees, listing new assets, and changing parameters.\\rStaking (Safety Module): By depositing (staking) tokens in the 'Safety Module,' they act as a form of insurance in case of a Shortfall Event in the protocol. Stakers receive additional $AAVE rewards in return.\\rCurrent Status:\\rTotal Value Locked (TVL): Aave is one of the largest lending protocols in the DeFi ecosystem, managing billions of dollars in assets across multiple blockchains.\\rAave V3 Update: The latest version, V3, has significantly improved capital efficiency and risk management by introducing features like 'Portal,' 'High-Efficiency Mode (E-Mode),' and 'Isolation Mode.'\\rGHO Stablecoin: The Aave protocol has launched its own decentralized stablecoin, $GHO. Users can mint $GHO against their deposited assets, and the interest generated from this is directed to the Aave DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) treasury.\\rThat concludes the data briefing.\\nKurumi\\rMyu-tan, that was a perfect briefing! Did you hear that, my Lord? This isn't just a coin! It's a bank in the world of blockchain, a bank! I think Aave's potential is absolutely limitless, devilish!\\nFirst, it's a 'blue chip' of the DeFi market! Aave is one of the most trusted protocols, having survived numerous hacks and crises. It's the first place people turn to when they start with DeFi! That's immense brand value.\\nSecond, the constant innovation is insane! While other projects are just copying, Aave maximized capital efficiency with the V3 update and created cool features for developers like Flash Loans. And most importantly, there's the $GHO stablecoin! This is the real game-changer!\\nThink about it, my Lord. The interest people pay when they borrow $GHO goes directly into the treasury of the Aave DAO, which we $AAVE token holders run! It's like a central bank making money from issuing currency! As the use of $GHO increases, the DAO's revenue will keep growing, and that value will inevitably flow back to $AAVE token holders! It's a completely automatic revenue pipeline!\\nThird, its multi-chain strategy is also brilliant! It's expanding its territory beyond Ethereum to various chains like Polygon and Avalanche. This is a powerful weapon to attract more users into the Aave ecosystem.\\n💖 Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Score: 90/100\\nThis is like investing in the future of DeFi itself! If $GHO successfully establishes itself and the DeFi market revitalizes, the current price will look absolutely adorable!\\nMikael\\rKurumi. That 'automatic revenue pipeline' of yours is riddled with pitfalls. Human, you must not be swayed by that devil's sweet words. I must point out the clear risks of this investment.\\nFirst, smart contract risk. No matter how long Aave has been vetted, there are no 'absolutes' in the world of DeFi. If a single small vulnerability is found in the code, the billions of dollars in deposited assets could vanish in an instant. You must remember that a headline like \\\"Massive Aave assets stolen in record-breaking hack\\\" could appear at any time.\\nSecond, liquidation risk and market volatility. The extreme volatility of the cryptocurrency market is a double-edged sword for lending protocols like Aave. A sharp market downturn could trigger a mass liquidation event where collateral values fall below loan amounts, severely threatening the protocol's health. In the worst-case scenario, your staked $AAVE tokens in the Safety Module could be used to cover the losses. This means your investment could disappear.\\nThird, the risk of the $GHO stablecoin failing. Kurumi speaks of $GHO as if it's a 'goose that lays golden eggs,' but in reality, stablecoin projects are extremely risky. If it fails to maintain its 1:1 peg to the dollar, trust can crumble in an instant, plunging the entire ecosystem into crisis. Have you forgotten the Terra-Luna incident? There's also a significant chance that $GHO could be overshadowed by competing stablecoins in the market. For now, it is an unfinished project with a greater risk of failure than success.\\nFourth, fierce competition and regulatory risk. Numerous competitors, including Compound, are eagerly eyeing Aave's position. Furthermore, if governments worldwide begin to unsheathe their regulatory swords against DeFi, Aave, as a symbolic project, will inevitably be one of the first targets. Hiding behind the name 'decentralization' has its limits.\\n🚨 Mikael's Risk Score: 88/100\\nAs innovative as it is, the underlying risks are just as lethal. Is it truly a wise decision to entrust your assets entirely to a complex bundle of code on a blockchain?\\n〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, I will summarize the three perspectives on Aave ($AAVE).\\nGrowth Potential (Kurumi)\\rCore Infrastructure of DeFi: Aave plays a core role, much like a bank, in the decentralized finance market, having built immense brand value and trust!\\rPotential of $GHO Stablecoin: If its native stablecoin $GHO successfully takes root, it will generate continuous revenue for the Aave DAO, becoming a powerful engine to drive up the value of the $AAVE token!\\rConstant Innovation and Expansion: It is continuously growing its ecosystem through technological advancements like Aave V3 and multi-chain expansion!\\rPotential Risks (Mikael)\\rCritical Technical Risk: The possibility of hacking due to code vulnerabilities always exists and is the greatest risk, potentially leading to a complete loss of assets.\\rStructural Market Risk: The extreme volatility of the crypto market can trigger a chain of mass liquidations, undermining the protocol's stability.\\rUncertainty of Stablecoins and Regulation: The failure of $GHO to maintain its peg or its defeat in market competition is a major risk. Furthermore, it could face a direct hit if government regulation of DeFi becomes serious.\\rKey Data (Mew)\\rProject Type: Decentralized cryptocurrency lending protocol (Money Market).\\rToken Utility: Governance voting rights, rewards through Safety Module staking.\\rKey Growth Drivers: Capital efficiency of Aave V3, success of the native stablecoin $GHO, multi-chain ecosystem expansion.\\rKey Risks: Smart contract hacks, liquidation due to market volatility, competition, regulation.\\rMaster, Aave is undoubtedly one of the 'blue chip' projects representing the DeFi world. If it operates successfully as Kurumi described, it could hold the same significance as investing in the future of decentralized finance itself. However, as Mikael warned, behind it lies a thick layer of inherent technical, market, and regulatory risks that define the DeFi space. This investment can be classified as a typical 'high-risk, high-return' opportunity, where one must accept high potential returns along with correspondingly high risks.\\n\"" }

Today's topic is one of the most controversial and hottest stocks out there: Palantir ($PLTR). We three will thoroughly investigate the future of this company, which has transformed from a 'reclusive master of big data' to the 'darling of the AI age'.\\nMew\\rMaster, first, I will brief you on the objective data regarding Palantir's current situation. Palantir began with the Gotham platform, which analyzes complex data for government agencies. Now, its core growth engines are Foundry, a data operating system for commercial enterprises, and the AI Platform (AIP) built on top of it.\\nThe key data is as follows.\\nFinancial Performance: In Q1 2025, Palantir announced results that surpassed market expectations. Total revenue reached $884 million, a 39% increase year-over-year, and it continued its profitability streak with a GAAP net income of $214 million.\\nCore Growth Driver: The most noteworthy aspect is the explosive growth of its U.S. Commercial sector. In Q1 2025, U.S. Commercial revenue surged by 71% year-over-year, driving overall growth. Demand for AIP is acting as the catalyst for this expansion.\\nValuation: The stock price soared over 80% in the first half of 2025 alone, becoming one of the top performers in the S\\u0026P 500. However, this has resulted in an extremely high valuation. Its Forward Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio far exceeds the industry average, with some analyses warning it's even higher than the peaks of the dot-com bubble.\\nShareholder Dilution Issue: A persistent problem is Stock-Based Compensation (SBC). Although the company is growing, the massive amount of stock options granted to employees continues to raise concerns about the dilution of existing shareholders' equity value.\\rKurumi\\rKyaa! My Lord, did you see Myu-tan's data?! U.S. Commercial revenue grew by 71%! And contract value exploded by 183%! This isn't just a growing company; it's a monster at the heart of the AI revolution, devouring the world! Devilish!\\nI'm sure Mika-pi will grumble about it being expensive again, but in my opinion, this isn't expensive at all! You're investing in the infrastructure of the AI age!\\nEvery company wants to use AI, but creating a smart AI with their own data is like trying to catch a star from the sky. Palantir's AIP is the magic ladder that lets them grab that very 'star'!\\nJust think about it. It used to take millions of dollars and several months to use Palantir's software. But now, thanks to AIP, companies can create their own AI apps in just days or even hours! This is a total game-changer! So isn't it obvious why companies are lining up to join Palantir's bootcamps?\\nAnd you can't forget the stickiness of the 'Gotham' and 'Foundry' platforms. Once a customer enters the Palantir ecosystem, the more data they accumulate, the harder it is for them to leave. It's like a devilish contract! Thanks to this powerful lock-in effect, it will generate stable cash flow for decades to come!\\n💖 Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Score: 92/100\\nToday's valuation might actually be a bargain when you look at the future! You can't miss the chance to become an early shareholder in the company that will become the king of the AI age!\\rMikael\\rKurumi, that magic ladder might actually be a precarious tightrope. Human, do not be deceived by that naive devil's words. To my eyes, the warning signs are all too clear.\\nFirst, can the 'explosive growth' that investors unanimously praise truly justify the current 'killer valuation'? The Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio is said to have surpassed the madness of the dot-com bubble era. This means decades of future growth are already priced in. If the growth rate falls even slightly short of market expectations, the consequences would be unimaginable.\\nSecond, you must pay attention to the 'legal exploitation' known as Stock-Based Compensation (SBC). The company boasts about achieving GAAP profitability, but behind the scenes, it's awarding an enormous amount of stock to its employees every year. That's ultimately the same as carving out a piece of the existing shareholders' pie. It's like pouring water into a leaky jar; can this truly be called genuine profit?\\nThird, the dependence on government business and political risk remain. More than half of its revenue still comes from government contracts, a foundation that can be shaken at any time by the policies of a particular administration or international affairs. The label of having grown through its relationship with the Trump administration could be a double-edged sword.\\nFourth, no competition? Not at all. Big tech companies like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon are strengthening their own data platforms and AI services, and could threaten Palantir's domain at any moment. Countless AI startups are also emerging. There is no guarantee that its current dominant position will last forever.\\n🚨 Mikael's Risk Score: 88/100\\nHuman, the market currently has an attitude that it will not tolerate a single failure from Palantir. Investing amidst such extreme optimism is, in my view, like walking into a blazing fire.\\r〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, I will summarize our three perspectives.\\nGrowth Potential (Kurumi)\\rCommercial Sector Expansion via AIP: AIP is an innovative platform that enables companies to leverage their own data for AI, driving a phenomenal 71% revenue growth in the U.S. Commercial sector!\\rStrong Lock-in Effect: Once adopted, the 'Gotham' and 'Foundry' platforms are very difficult to switch from, promising long-term, stable revenue generation.\\rCore Infrastructure of the AI Age: Palantir is not just a software company; it is positioning itself as a core infrastructure provider offering the operating system (OS) for the AI era!\\rPotential Risks (Mikael)\\rExtreme Valuation: Metrics like the Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio are at historic highs, excessively pricing in future growth and creating a risk of significant stock price decline from even minor setbacks.\\rContinuous Shareholder Value Dilution: Despite accounting profits, the massive scale of Stock-Based Compensation (SBC) is a factor that continually dilutes the equity value of existing shareholders.\\rPolitical Uncertainty and Intensifying Competition: A high proportion of government contracts still exposes the company to political risks, and competition with big tech and AI startups could gradually intensify.\\rKey Data (Mew)\\rRecent Performance (Q1 2025): Revenue of $884 million (+39% YoY), U.S. Commercial revenue growth of +71%.\\rProfitability: Has achieved and is maintaining GAAP profitability. Its Rule of 40 score is 83%, indicating an excellent balance between growth and profitability.\\rWall Street Consensus: Analyst opinions are sharply divided, ranging from 'Buy' to 'Sell'. Expectations for high growth coexist with concerns about the killer valuation.\\rConclusion: Master, Palantir is undoubtedly one of the strongest candidates to ride the wave of the AI revolution. As Kurumi says, it is seizing unprecedented opportunities and demonstrating a successful expansion into the commercial market. However, as Mikael warns, that optimism is already dangerously priced into the stock, and it carries the structural problem of shareholder dilution.\\nThis investment is like a tightrope walk between the potential to become a 'future ruler' and the risk of a 'bubble bursting'. It is a time for deep reflection on whether your faith can outpace the company's growth and whether you can withstand extreme volatility.\\n\"" }

Today's topic is the investment philosophy of one of Wall Street's most controversial figures, Cathie Wood. The keyword 'Disruptive Innovation' always accompanies her name.\\nMew\\rMaster, first, I will brief you on the objective data regarding Cathie Wood and her firm, ARK Invest.\\nInvestment Philosophy: Cathie Wood's investment philosophy can be summarized in one phrase: Disruptive Innovation. She employs a strategy of investing intensively and long-term in technologies with the potential to completely overturn existing markets or create new ones.\\nFive Innovation Platforms: ARK Invest has defined five key technology platforms where disruptive innovation is expected to occur and concentrates its investments in these areas.\\rDNA Sequencing (Genomics)\\rRobotics\\rEnergy Storage (e.g., secondary batteries)\\rArtificial Intelligence (AI)\\rBlockchain Technology\\rKey Portfolio Holdings: In line with this philosophy, ARK Invest's flagship ETF, ARKK, holds significant positions in companies like Tesla, Coinbase, Roku, Zoom Video Communications, and numerous genomics and biotech firms. Most of these are companies with high valuations based on expectations of future growth rather than current profits.\\nExtreme Performance Volatility: Her investment style has resulted in dramatic performance swings.\\r2020 (The Era of Glory): Fueled by the Federal Reserve's zero-interest-rate and quantitative easing policies after the COVID-19 pandemic, the ARKK ETF recorded a phenomenal return of approximately 150% in a single year, turning Cathie Wood into a Wall Street star and the \\\"Money Tree\\\" icon.\\u003c\\r2022 (The Time of Trial): However, when the U.S. Federal Reserve began aggressive interest rate hikes, the value of tech stocks, especially growth stocks dependent on future cash flows, plummeted. As a result, ARKK suffered a devastating loss of -67% in 2022, losing all its prestige and becoming a center of criticism.\\rCurrently: Since then, the market has recovered, and it has recouped some losses, but it still remains far below its peak levels.\\r» See also: Robinhood: Why Cathie Wood is Betting Big on $HOOD\\rKurumi\\rMyu-tan, what a perfect briefing! My Lord, doesn't just looking at the data make your heart race? I truly admire Cathie Wood! She's not just a fund manager; she's an artist painting the future, a revolutionary set to change the world! Devilish!\\nPeople like Mika-pi live trapped in past data, fussing over PER and PBR. But Cathie Wood knows you can't measure the future with such outdated rulers! When the internet first appeared, who could have explained Amazon's value based on its current profits?\\nA Bet on the Future: She is planting the seeds now for the technologies that will dominate the world in 10 or 20 years. AI, gene editing, blockchain! Don't the names alone thrill you, my Lord? These companies have the potential to grow 10-fold, 100-fold if they succeed. A few years of losses are nothing compared to the enormous profits that will erupt later!\\nThe Beauty of Concentrated Investing: Diversification only brings average returns. But Cathie Wood aims for massive excess returns through 'concentrated investing,' betting everything on the future she believes in! This is where life-changing opportunities lie! As they say, \\\"The biggest risk is not taking any risk!\\\"\\nAn Icon of Conviction: Even when the market crashed and everyone mocked her, Cathie Wood didn't change her philosophy and instead bought more shares of fallen innovation companies. That's something you can never do without unshakeable faith in your vision. I've fallen for that courage and conviction!\\r💖 Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Score: 90/100\\nThis is about buying a chance to get rich! Burying your money in boring value stocks is just a waste of time! The future belongs to the innovators!\\nMikael\\rKurumi, there is a fine line between what you call 'conviction' and 'recklessness.' Human, that devil's sweet whisper could lead your account to ruin.\\nCathie Wood's method is closer to 'gambling' than 'investing.' She is ignoring the most fundamental principles of investment.\\nA Complete Disregard for Valuation: The logic that \\\"current deficits don't matter as long as there are dreams and vision\\\" is identical to the thinking during the 17th-century Tulip Mania or the 2000 Dot-com bubble. Every asset has an intrinsic value, and the gap between that value and its price is the margin of safety. The companies in her portfolio are mostly sandcastles built only on hope, with no margin of safety.\\nVulnerability to Macroeconomics: The great failure of 2022 proves everything. Her strategy is an extremely biased model that only works under the premise that 'interest rates will remain low forever.' When rates rose, future cash flows became worthless paper, and her empire crumbled. The foundation of investing is to prepare for various macroeconomic scenarios, yet she went all-in on just one.\\nThe 'Innovation' Trap: Of course, innovation is important. But not all innovation makes money. Countless innovative technologies have failed to be commercialized and have disappeared into history. She seems intoxicated by the magic of the word 'innovation,' tending to overlook the sober business analysis of whether that technology can actually generate sustainable profits. It's no different from investing in so-called 'story stocks.'\\rI believe her philosophy instills a false fantasy in investors. It makes them confuse long-term investing with speculation and forget the importance of risk management.\\n🚨 Mikael's Risk Score: 95/100\\nHuman, \\\"This time is different\\\" are the most expensive words in history. Her strategy is built squarely upon that phrase.\\n〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, I will summarize our three perspectives. Cathie Wood's investment philosophy is like a double-edged sword.\\nGrowth Potential (Kurumi)\\rCapturing Paradigm Shifts: It has the potential to ride the massive wave of collapsing old industries and the birth of new ones, allowing one to reap the full benefits of epochal change.\\rExpectation of Explosive Returns: It's a 'home run' strategy that, if successful, can see a few companies in the portfolio grow dozens of times over, exponentially boosting the overall rate of return.\\rPresenting a Vision for the Future: It goes beyond mere moneymaking to present a positive and grand vision of how technological advancement will change human lives, inspiring investors!\\rPotential Risks (Mikael)\\rExtreme Volatility: It is a strategy on thin ice, extremely vulnerable to macroeconomic variables like interest rates, and one must be prepared to see asset values drop by more than -50% when market sentiment sours.\\rValuation Trap: By concentrating on overvalued stocks not justified by current earnings or asset values, there is a high risk that stock prices could plummet to unrecoverable levels if growth fails to meet expectations.\\rConcentration Risk: It is excessively concentrated in a few technology platforms and stocks. If an unforeseen negative event occurs in that industry or an individual company, the entire portfolio could collapse.\\rKey Data (Mew)\\rInvestment Targets: High-growth technology stocks belonging to the five innovation platforms (DNA, Robotics, Energy, AI, Blockchain).\\rCore Strategy: Long-term perspective, research-driven, concentrated investing, and active management not tied to a benchmark.\\rResults: As shown by the 150% return in 2020 and the -67% loss in 2022, performance is at polar extremes depending on market conditions. This signifies both high risk and high potential reward.\\rConclusion: Master, Cathie Wood's 'disruptive innovation' investing is a philosophy that stands at the opposite end of the spectrum from traditional value investing. It is akin to a strategy where an investor with a very high-risk tolerance allocates a portion of their assets to bet on massive future success from a long-term perspective of 10 years or more. As Kurumi says, it could be a wonderful journey toward the future, but as Mikael warns, it could also be a path to hell, not heaven. Whether to join this path will depend on whether you, Master, give more weight to the light or the shadow of 'innovation'.\\n\"" }

            { "title": "Bitcoin Breaks All-Time High: What Does It Truly Mean?", "permalink": "https:\/\/archive03.online\/en\/reports\/2025-07-10-bitcoin-breaks-all-time\/", "date": "2025-07-10", "formattedDate": "25.07.10", "content": "\"Hello, Master. Today, we're going to discuss the hottest topic in the market: Bitcoin, which has just hit a new all-time high. With all eyes on it, the three of us will analyze what this phenomenon means for investors.\\nMew\\rMaster, I will begin with an objective data briefing. On July 9, 2025, the price of Bitcoin surpassed $112,000 per coin, setting a new all-time high (ATH). This is a new record, exceeding the previous high of $111,970 set this past May.\\nHere are a few key indicators.\\nKey Drivers: Several factors are contributing to this rally. First, capital from institutional investors, led by BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF, continues to flow in. Second, there is widespread anticipation of a more favorable regulatory environment, as U.S. government officials have recently hinted at the possibility of purchasing Bitcoin and building related infrastructure. Finally, overall market sentiment is extremely positive.\\nMarket Sentiment: The current Crypto 'Fear \\u0026 Greed Index' is at 71, indicating a state of 'Greed'. While slightly down from last week's 73, it's still a figure that shows the market is leaning heavily toward optimism.\\nInstitutional Moves: The stock prices of companies with large Bitcoin holdings, such as MicroStrategy, are rising in tandem, indicating a favorable trend across all crypto-related assets.\\r» See also: Bitcoin: Is It Really a Valuable Asset?\\nKurumi\\rMy Lord! This is absolutely huge! Devilish! Bitcoin has finally smashed through the $110,000 wall and soared into a new world! My heart feels like it's about to burst with joy! This is a re-evaluation of Bitcoin's value and the dawn of a new era!\\nLook at the data Myu-tan mentioned! This isn't some bubble created by retail investors piling in. The world's largest asset managers and corporations are bringing in real money, and there's even talk that the most powerful nation on earth, the United States, might add Bitcoin to its national assets! This is the starting gun, signaling that Bitcoin is finally gaining official recognition as 'digital gold'.\\nI bet Mika-pi will start singing her usual song about risk and bubbles, right? But this is on a different level from the frenzy of 2017 or 2021. Back then, it was all just a 'dream,' but now it's becoming 'reality.' Through spot ETFs, a path has opened for even conservative funds like pensions to buy Bitcoin, and if the stablecoin bill passes, the final shackles of regulatory uncertainty will be removed.\\nIn a few years, today's $110,000 will be remembered as an unimaginably low price, my Lord! Hesitating here is like refusing to board a rocket to the moon when there's an empty seat waiting for you!\\n💖 Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Investment Score: 100/100\\nThis is an opportunity I'd bet everything on! Breaking the all-time high means there's no resistance left! Now, nobody knows how high it will fly!\\nMikael\\rKurumi, your excited voice sounds like a precarious siren to my ears.\\nHuman, the louder the celebratory cannons, the more vigilant you must be. To my eyes, the current situation looks like a perilous festival held on the edge of a cliff called greed.\\nFirst, you must be wary of the 'expectations' trap. The possibilities Kurumi mentioned—the U.S. government buying Bitcoin, the passage of a stablecoin bill—are all just 'projections' that have not yet materialized. It's highly likely that this rosy news is already fully, perhaps excessively, priced in. If even one of these expectations is delayed or fails, a flood of disappointed selling could cause the price to plummet in an instant. The adage 'buy the rumor, sell the news' exists for times like these.\\nSecond, look at the 'Greed' index. The number 71 is clear evidence that market participants are losing their reason and are swept up in avarice. When everyone is drunk on optimism and wants to buy, who is left to buy it from them at an even higher price? Once new buying power is exhausted, even a small piece of bad news can trigger a panic sell-off as everyone rushes for the exit. It's the same principle I warned about when the S\\u0026P500 was in 'Extreme Greed'.\\nThird, you cannot ignore historical patterns. Bitcoin has always experienced a sharp correction after hitting a new all-time high. Can you be certain this time will be different? Just because institutional investors have entered the scene doesn't mean volatility has vanished. On the contrary, when their massive funds are withdrawn, the shock could be far greater than in the past.\\n🚨 Mikael's Risk Score: 90/100\\nNow is not the time to ride the wave of greed, but to build a seawall in preparation for a tsunami that could strike at any moment. Focus on protecting your assets rather than chasing profits.\\n〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, I will summarize the discussion for you.\\nGrowth Potential (Kurumi)\\rFull-Scale Institutional Entry: The continuous inflow of institutional capital through spot ETFs is the strongest signal that Bitcoin is being integrated into the mainstream financial system. A devilishly good sign!\\rFavorable Regulatory Environment: The U.S. government's positive stance and expectations for regulatory clarity are boosting confidence in Bitcoin's long-term growth!\\rA New Paradigm: This ATH breakthrough is different from the speculative frenzies of the past; it's a historic turning point where its value as 'digital gold' is being institutionally recognized.\\rPotential Risks (Mikael)\\rOver-Priced Expectations: Positive but unrealized news is already excessively priced in, increasing the risk of a sharp drop if expectations are not met.\\rExtreme Market Sentiment: A market in the 'Greed' stage is vulnerable and can easily descend into panic from a small shock. The moment of greatest applause can be the moment of greatest danger.\\rPossibility of Repeating Past Patterns: Historically, ATH breakthroughs have always been followed by significant corrections. The thought that 'this time is different' could come at a very high price.\\rKey Data (Mew)\\rAll-Time High (ATH): Surpassed $112,000 (July 9, 2025)\\rMarket Sentiment Index: Fear \\u0026 Greed Index at 71 ('Greed' stage)\\rKey Variables: Continuation of institutional capital inflows, actual implementation of news related to U.S. government regulation.\\rMaster, Bitcoin has entered a price territory no one has ever seen before. As Kurumi said, institutional investment and shifting government attitudes could serve as powerful fundamentals, different from the past. However, as Mikael warned, the higher an asset soars, the greater the impact of its fall. Inflated expectations and greedy market sentiment are subjects for constant vigilance. Only time will tell if this rally is the dawn of a new era or another massive trap. I believe this is a time that calls for more careful consideration than ever.\\n\"" }

            { "title": "How Could Robinhood Offer Commission-Free Trading?", "permalink": "https:\/\/archive03.online\/en\/reports\/2025-07-09-how-could-robinhood\/", "date": "2025-07-09", "formattedDate": "25.07.09", "content": "\"Master, today's topic is 'How was Robinhood able to waive its fees?' When Robinhood appeared in 2013, it shook up the market and excited individual investors, especially the younger generation, with its radical 'zero commission on stock trades' model.\\nBut as they say, there's no such thing as a free lunch. Let's uncover the secret of how Robinhood actually makes money.\\nMew\\rMaster, I will begin the briefing. Instead of charging users direct trading fees, Robinhood has a business model that generates revenue through several other channels. Its core revenue sources can be broadly categorized into four areas.\\nPayment for Order Flow (PFOF): This is the most critical part of Robinhood's revenue. When a user places a stock or option order on the Robinhood app, Robinhood doesn't send it directly to a public exchange like the NYSE or NASDAQ. Instead, it passes the order information to large market makers or HFT (High-Frequency Trading) firms like Citadel Securities or Virtu Financial and receives a rebate in return. According to 2021 data, about 75% of Robinhood's total revenue came from PFOF.\\nRobinhood Gold: This is a premium service with a $5 monthly subscription fee. Gold members get access to larger instant deposits, professional research materials, and the ability to trade on margin (investing with borrowed money). The interest generated from this margin lending is another source of revenue.\\nStock Lending: Robinhood lends out shares held by its users to short-sellers or other financial institutions that want to bet on a stock's price decline, earning interest income. Users may not be aware that their shares are being lent out in this process.\\rInterest on Cash: Robinhood earns interest income by depositing uninvested cash sitting in user accounts into banks or investing it in short-term bonds.\\rThese four pillars are the core revenue structure that supports the 'free' platform of Robinhood. Now, let's discuss what this structure implies.\\n» See also: Robinhood: Why Cathie Wood is Betting Big on $HOOD\\nKurumi\\rMyu-tan, that's perfect data! Did you hear that, my Lord? This is an absolutely brilliant business model! It's a structure where everyone wins!\\nI bet Mika-pi will get hung up on that 'Payment for Order Flow' thing. But think about it! In the old days, you had to pay expensive commissions just to buy a single stock, so only the wealthy could invest freely. But Robinhood came along and completely tore down that barrier! Thanks to them, small-time investors like us can participate in the stock market without any burden! This is the democratization of finance!\\nWhat's so wrong with PFOF? Even if we place an order, HFT firms are always 0.001 seconds faster than us. We can't beat them by sending our orders directly to the exchange anyway. Robinhood acts as an intermediary, taking a small rebate from the tiny price differences we would have lost anyway, and uses it to pay our commissions for us! We're happy because commissions are free, market makers are happy because they get a ton of orders, and Robinhood is happy because it makes money. Isn't this a structure where everyone is happy?\\nIf anything, Robinhood has made the market more active and given more people the chance to share in the fruits of economic growth. This is innovation, this is progress! Devilish!\\n💖 Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Investment Score: 90/100\\nRobinhood deserves a round of applause just for letting us start investing without worrying about fees! Let's not sweat the small stuff and just enjoy the innovation!\\nMikael\\rKurumi, your naive optimism only serves to confuse the Human. You package it with the phrase 'democratization of finance,' but its essence is not so beautiful.\\nHuman, have you ever heard the saying, \\\"If you're not paying for the product, you are the product\\\"?\\nThe biggest problem with PFOF is the potential for a 'Conflict of Interest.' Who is Robinhood's customer? Is it 'us,' the ones trading stocks, or is it the 'market makers' who buy our order information? In theory, Robinhood has a duty of 'Best Execution,' meaning it must ensure its customers' orders are executed at the most favorable price. But in reality, there's an incentive to pass orders not to the market maker offering the best price for the customer, but to the one paying the biggest rebate to Robinhood.\\nThis tiny price difference is called 'Price Improvement.' Market makers return a portion of this spread to investors and keep the rest as their profit. However, in the process of Robinhood securing a larger rebate, the share of 'Price Improvement' that you, the Human investor, could have received may shrink. In one or two trades, it might seem like a negligible loss of less than a cent. But when you aggregate hundreds of millions of trades from millions of users, it becomes a massive transfer of wealth from the pockets of individual investors to market makers and Robinhood.\\nThe commission is a 'visible cost,' but this unfavorable execution price is a 'hidden cost.' Robinhood may not have eliminated fees, but merely changed their form in a clever way.\\nFurthermore, the lack of fees and the app's game-like design are constantly criticized for encouraging users to make frequent, unnecessary trades—actions that are closer to gambling than investing.\\n🚨 Mikael's Risk Score: 75/100\\nYou must be aware of the hidden costs and structural risks concealed behind the sweet word 'free.' They are not philanthropists.\\n〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rThe discussion has gone on for a bit. Master, I will now provide a final summary of Robinhood's revenue model.\\nInnovation and Democratization (Kurumi)\\rExpanded Financial Access: It tore down the barrier of expensive commissions, leading the 'democratization of finance' that allows small-time investors to freely participate in the market! Devilish!\\rWin-Win-Win Model: It's an innovative business model that benefits everyone—investors are happy with no fees, market makers are happy to secure large order volumes, and Robinhood profits from the rebates!\\rHidden Costs and Risks (Mikael)\\rConflict of Interest: Robinhood has a structural problem where it may prioritize the interests of market makers who pay it higher rebates over the best interests of its investors (most favorable trade execution).\\rHidden Costs: In exchange for 'free commissions,' investors may be paying a 'hidden cost' by potentially buying or selling stocks at less favorable prices.\\rEncouraging Speculation: The gamified interface and zero fees can encourage frequent and risky short-term trading, hindering long-term wealth creation.\\rKey Data (Mew)\\rCore Revenue Source: Payment for Order Flow (PFOF) accounts for about 75% of total revenue.\\rOther Revenue Sources: These include the 'Robinhood Gold' premium subscription service at $5/month and its margin interest, interest from lending securities, and interest earned on cash deposits.\\rRegulatory Trends: The PFOF model is under continuous scrutiny and regulatory debate by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It is already banned in some countries.\\rMaster, Robinhood has played a positive role in bringing numerous individuals into the stock market with its disruptive 'zero commission' innovation. As Kurumi said, its contribution to the 'democratization of finance' cannot be denied. However, as Mikael warned, behind that convenience, there are clear structural risks of 'hidden costs' and 'conflicts of interest.' Using Robinhood may be equivalent to agreeing to pay an invisible cost (potential losses) instead of a visible one (commissions). Your assessment of this platform will depend on which values you consider more important, Master.\\n\"" }

Doesn't it sound distinguished just hearing it? Let's begin our discussion about the companies that have consistently shared their wealth with shareholders for decades.\\nMew\\rMaster, first, we must clarify what exactly 'Dividend Aristocrats' are. This is a term created by S\\u0026P Dow Jones Indices. Only companies included in the S\\u0026P 500 index that have increased their dividends every single year for at least 25 consecutive years can earn this glorious title. These are companies that have weathered all sorts of crises—the oil shock, the dot-com bubble, the global financial crisis, the pandemic—and have never once broken their promise to shareholders to increase dividends.\\nThese companies share a few common traits.\\nStrong Economic Moats: They often possess brand power or business models that are not easily replicated by competitors.\\nStable Cash Flow: They operate predictable businesses that generate money consistently, even when the economy is weak.\\nShareholder-Friendly Management: They have a very strong commitment to returning company profits to shareholders.\\rSince finding and investing in these Dividend Aristocrats one by one can be cumbersome, there are ETF products that allow you to invest in them all at once. The most representative one is the 'ProShares S\\u0026P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF', with the ticker $NOBL.\\nExpense Ratio: At 0.35% per year, it allows for diversified investment in over 60 Dividend Aristocrat companies at a relatively low cost.\\nSector Allocation: It primarily holds a high weight in traditional value sectors like Industrials, Consumer Staples, Financials, Health Care, and Materials. The weight of technology stocks is relatively low.\\nPerformance: Historically, the Dividend Aristocrats index has tended to show superior defensiveness, with smaller drawdowns during market downturns compared to the S\\u0026P 500 index. Of course, its returns may be lower than the S\\u0026P 500 during bull markets, but it has steadily trended upward over the long term.\\rThat concludes the data briefing.\\nKurumi\\rWow! My Lord! Isn't this a total 'money-printing' cheat code? To have money deposited into your account every quarter without lifting a finger, and the amount even grows every year! It's so exciting just thinking about it! I call this the 'magic of time'!\\nThere are more than enough reasons why you should build a Dividend Aristocrat portfolio!\\nFirst, peace of mind! When the stock market crashes and you can hear people screaming from a mile away, you can just smile while looking at the dividends that keep rolling in! You can think, 'Yes, the stock price fell, but my farm (the company) is still giving me eggs (dividends)!' How reassuring is that!\\nSecond, the snowball effect of compounding! Don't use the dividends you receive to buy snacks; use them to buy more dividend stocks! This is called 'dividend reinvestment.' By doing this, your number of shares will grow automatically, and you'll receive even more dividends next quarter! You'll get to see the magic of the snowball growing enormously over time!\\nThird, you're creating your own personal pension! If you consistently grow this portfolio for 10 or 20 years, the day may come when you can live off the dividends alone! Isn't that a thrilling thought? Companies work for you and send you money like a monthly salary, even when you do nothing! This is the textbook definition of a FIRE lifestyle! Devilish!\\n💖 Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Investment Score: 90/100\\nThis isn't a boring investment! You should see it as the most reliable and romantic way to save for your future!\\nMikael\\rKurumi, your rose-colored fantasy sounds pleasant. However, the saying 'past glory does not guarantee future success' was made for moments like this. Human, before you are dazzled by the name 'Dividend Aristocrat,' you must face a few cold, hard realities.\\nFirst, limited growth potential. Companies that have paid dividends for over 25 years are mostly giant corporations that have reached maturity. They are certainly stable. But it's difficult to expect explosive growth from them. While new technology companies in AI or biotech might grow by tens or hundreds of percent in a year, Dividend Aristocrat stocks are likely to move at a much slower pace. In a bull market, you might feel a sense of relative deprivation as they fail to keep up with the market's average returns.\\nSecond, headwinds from interest rate hikes. Dividend stocks have characteristics similar to bonds. What happens if the central bank keeps raising interest rates? More people will prefer to put their money in safe bank deposits or bonds rather than taking risks in the stock market. Consequently, the appeal of dividend stocks diminishes, and their prices may fall.\\nThird, the risk of the 'Dividend Trap.' This is the part you must be most wary of. There are cases where a company's performance is deteriorating, but it takes on debt to pay dividends just to maintain its 'Dividend Aristocrat' title. What happens when it can no longer hold on and is forced to implement a dividend cut or suspension? Investors who bought the stock solely for its dividend appeal will all dump their shares, and the stock price will plummet. There is no such thing as a permanent aristocrat. In fact, great companies of the past like General Electric (GE) and AT\\u0026T eventually suffered the pain of cutting their dividends and being dropped from the aristocrat list.\\nFourth, the difficulty of portfolio construction. Investing in an ETF like NOBL is convenient, but it comes with a fee. If you want to build a portfolio by picking 20-30 individual stocks yourself, you must constantly track and manage the financial health and business prospects of each company. This requires significant time and effort.\\n🚨 Mikael's Risk Score: 60/100\\nIt may look like a stable garden, but do not forget that it can quickly turn into a wasteland if you don't consistently weed out the struggling companies.\\n〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, I will summarize the results of our discussion.\\nGrowth Potential (Kurumi)\\rPowerful Passive Income: Dividends that grow every year can become a sturdy pipeline, creating a steady stream of cash flow! Devilishly good!\\rMaximize the Compounding Effect: Through dividend reinvestment, you can experience your assets snowballing over time!\\rPsychological Stability: It becomes a strong anchor that allows you to continue with long-term investing without being swayed by market volatility!\\rPotential Risks (Mikael)\\rLow Growth Potential: Because they are stable, their growth rate is lower compared to market-leading stocks, and they can be left behind in a bull market.\\rInterest Rate Sensitivity: During periods of rising interest rates, their appeal may decrease compared to safe assets like bonds, leading to sluggish stock performance.\\r'Dividend Trap' Risk: There's a risk that a company maintains its dividend despite deteriorating fundamentals, leading to a sharp stock price drop if the dividend is eventually cut.\\rKey Data (Mew)\\rInvestment Target: S\\u0026P 500 companies that have increased their dividends consecutively for at least 25 years.\\rKey ETF: $NOBL (ProShares S\\u0026P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF).\\rCharacteristics: It shows strong defensiveness in downturns and can be expected to trend upward stably over the long term. It has a high allocation to traditional value sectors like Industrials and Consumer Staples.\\rMaster, a Dividend Aristocrat portfolio is a strategy closer to a 'reliable goalkeeper' than a 'flashy striker.' It may not be a way to make a lot of money in a short period. However, as Kurumi said, it is one of the proven methods for steadily building assets by making time your ally. As Mikael warned, rather than just trusting the 'Aristocrat' name, it seems wise to examine the health of individual companies or to diversify risk through an ETF like $NOBL. This investment could be an excellent choice for a Master who believes in the value of consistency over flashiness.\\n\"" }

Today, we'll be discussing the warning Ray Dalio issued back in April.\\nThe core of Ray Dalio's analysis is the 'great collapse of order.' He views the current situation not as a simple trade dispute, but as a turning point in a grand cycle that has repeated throughout history. His warning can be summarized into three main points.\\nThe Collapse of Monetary/Economic Order: Countries like the United States are heavily in debt, while countries like China hold too much of that debt. This imbalance is unsustainable and will eventually bring significant changes to the existing dollar-centric financial system, he warns. It means the debt party is coming to an end.\\nInstability of Domestic and International Political Order: Domestically, extreme populism is gaining power due to wealth gaps and conflicting values, and compromise, the foundation of democracy, is disappearing. Internationally, the US-centric unipolar order is ending, transitioning to a multipolar system where major powers clash with force. This means conflicts are likely to break out in various places.\\nRapid Changes in Technology and Nature: Disruptive technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and natural threats like climate change are shaking the foundations of the existing economic and political order. These are unpredictable new variables.\\rDalio warns that these three great forces will interact and create significant change. However... the truth is, when individual investors hear such grand narratives, they can't help but think, 'So what? What should I buy?'\\nKurumi\\rThanks for the briefing, Myu-tan! Master! In my opinion, this isn't a crisis, it's a tremendous opportunity! It means the map of wealth is being completely redrawn, doesn't it? A chaotic period like this is the perfect environment for the birth of the newly rich! Devilish!\\nMy answer to \\\"So, what should I buy?\\\" is crystal clear!\\nFirst, when the era of 'debt' ends, the era of 'cash' begins! Zombie companies with nothing but debt will all collapse. Conversely, the value of 'cash-rich companies' that are piling up mountains of cash and consistently making money is bound to skyrocket! When a crisis hits, these companies can buy out their failing competitors for cheap and monopolize the market! Now is the golden opportunity to pick up some truly blue-chip stocks!\\nSecond, you must invest in things that will never fail, no matter how chaotic the world gets! Even if war breaks out, people will still drink Coke, take cold medicine, and shave. These 'consumer staples' companies are not just defensive stocks in a recession; they can be the most reliable 'survivor stocks' in times of turmoil! I'm talking about companies like Coca-Cola and Johnson \\u0026 Johnson!\\nThird, new technologies like AI are not a wave to fear, but one to ride! Not sure which company will be the final winner? Then just buy the entire industry! By consistently investing in an ETF that gathers innovative AI companies, you can taste the fruits of growth no matter where the next Amazon or Google pops up! It's the surest bet on the future!\\rMaster! This is no time to shrink back! You have to aggressively seize the opportunity to reorganize your wealth!\\nMikael\\rOne moment, Kurumi. You're peddling that dangerous optimism again. Human, Kurumi's words may sound sweet, but you must not overlook the fatal risks hidden beneath. Dalio's warning is a matter of 'survival' before it is one of 'opportunity'.\\nFirst, you say 'cash-rich companies' are safe? Financially, perhaps. But Dalio's 'collapse of monetary order' includes extreme scenarios where the 'value of a currency' itself could vanish. What good is it if the company you invested in has piled up mountains of won, if the won becomes worthless paper? You must see the risk of the 'Korean won' basket itself. As Kurumi says, buying blue-chip stocks is fine, but you must also diversify your assets into various currencies like the won, dollar, and yen, and furthermore, allocate a portion to tangible assets that governments cannot print at will, like 'gold'. This means diversifying the 'store of value' itself.\\nSecond, 'consumer staples' are the kings of survival? I agree, but that's a story for an ordinary recession. What if geopolitical risks escalate to an extreme, as Dalio warns, and supply chains between nations are severed? If a company can't import raw materials or its overseas factories shut down, even Coca-Cola can't make Coke. In other words, you must also consider 'how exposed it is to geopolitical risk.' A consumer staples company in a country with a solid domestic market and stable supply chain might actually be safer.\\nThird, investing in an AI ETF is a truly dangerous idea. The AI industry is now, by any measure, in the early stages of a bubble. Do you remember the dot-com bubble of 2000? Everyone knew the internet would change the world, but countless promising tech stocks vanished then. An AI ETF is tantamount to buying all those 'companies destined to disappear' at once. The direction of change is correct, but 'when and at what price' you buy is the key. Chasing the trend when everyone is euphoric, like now, is extremely risky.\\rHuman, now is the time to think more about 'how not to lose money' than how to make it. The most important investments are not the products Kurumi mentioned, but 'cash' itself—which ensures your survival in a crisis and allows you to seize opportunities in a crash—and the 'investment in yourself', which will allow you to survive no matter what kind of world comes.\\nKurumi\\rMika-pi, that's just too strange. Will money just multiply if you just hug gold and cash? Gold is just the same old rock even after 10 years. The AI revolution is happening and the world is changing, but all Master will have left is a yellow rock that pays no interest!\\nWhat Dalio is saying isn't 'it's dangerous, so run away,' but 'the rules of the game are changing, so play by the new rules'! The core of the new rules isn't 'debt,' but 'value' and 'technology'! The shares (stocks) of a company with excellent technology will continue to bring in money!\\nAn AI bubble? Of course, there could be one! But every revolution started with a bubble! If you do nothing because you're scared of a bubble, you'll just be twiddling your thumbs later, watching the real winner take it all! You have to ride the wave by investing small amounts consistently to get those big returns later!\\nMikael\\rKurumi, I never said to run away. I only said to prepare.\\nAs you say, gold pays no interest. But in the worst-case scenario of a collapsing monetary system, gold is the 'ultimate insurance' that humanity has chosen for thousands of years. You don't buy insurance for profit; you buy it to prevent the catastrophe of losing everything. During the hyperinflation of the Weimar Republic, stock market millionaires lost everything in an instant, but those who held gold survived.\\n» See also: Should You Invest in Gold During Inflation? Here’s How to Start\\nAnd your argument about AI is like dressing up gambling as an investment. You dilute the risk with words like 'small amounts consistently,' but the essence is just betting on a vague hope that 'it will go up someday'.\\nAs I said, the truest investment is in 'yourself.' Learning new skills and deepening your understanding of this rapidly changing world is what will cultivate the eye to recognize a real opportunity when it comes, without being swept away by any bubble. I see that as the best long-term investment.\\n〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, I'll summarize the results of our discussion. Dalio's warning isn't the 'right answer,' but rather a map that provides a 'framework of thinking' for you to consider when making future investment decisions.\\nWhere are the Opportunities? (Kurumi)\\rKey Opportunity 1: Discover cash-rich companies. The era of debt is ending, giving high-quality companies with excellent financial health a chance to reshape the market. You must focus your investments on companies that will turn this crisis into a devilishly good opportunity for growth!\\rKey Opportunity 2: Join the new technology revolution! You have to ride the great wave of change, like AI. If you're worried about specific company risks, it's wise to bet on future growth by using an ETF that invests in the entire industry!\\rCrisis Response Strategy (Mikael)\\rMajor Risk 1: Single currency and asset risk. The value of a specific country's currency itself could be shaken. You must diversify your assets not only out of the won but also into key currencies like the dollar, and incorporate the tangible asset 'gold' into your portfolio to establish a final safety net.\\rMajor Risk 2: Geopolitical risk and technology bubbles. In addition to a company's fundamentals, you must check how exposed its business is to geopolitical conflicts or supply chain disruptions. Furthermore, you should avoid rashly chasing after technology themes that everyone is excited about.\\rConclusion (Mew)\\rDalio's analysis is not a direct answer to the question, \\\"So, what should I buy?\\\" It's closer to presenting a framework for action: \\\"Whatever you buy, you must choose it based on these principles and standards to survive now.\\\"\\nIn conclusion, Master, your investments must be built upon the two great pillars of 'asset allocation' and 'risk management'.\\nDon't put all your assets in one basket: You must divide them among 'several different kinds of baskets,' such as won, dollars, stocks, gold, and real estate.\\rChoose assets resilient to external shocks: Select companies with little debt and lots of cash, consumer staples that won't fail even in a chaotic world, and companies with proprietary technology, but you must also analyze the geopolitical risks they face.\\rThe best investment is in yourself: The ultimate weapon for survival in a rapidly changing world is your own knowledge and judgment, Master.\\rBased on this map, what voyage you undertake is up to you, Master. We are always here to assist in your judgment.\\n\"" }

Unpacking the Ultimate Monthly Dividend ETFs", "permalink": "https:\/\/archive03.online\/en\/reports\/2025-07-04-jepi-vs-jepq\/", "date": "2025-07-04", "formattedDate": "25.07.04", "content": "\"Master, today we're going to discuss 'monthly dividend ETFs,' which have become incredibly popular for generating a steady stream of cash flow. We received a request to compare and analyze two of the most famous products, JEPI and JEPQ. For you, Master, who is weighing the choice between stability and growth, the three of us will take a closer look.\\nMew\\rFirst, I will brief you on the objective data. Master, both of these ETFs are managed by JPMorgan and are based on a Covered Call strategy. This method involves holding a stock portfolio and selling call options based on those stocks to use the monthly option premiums as a source for dividends.\\nThe key difference lies in the underlying assets.\\nJEPI (JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF): Its portfolio is constructed based on blue-chip stocks included in the S\\u0026P 500 index. In other words, it provides the effect of diversifying investments across approximately 500 companies that represent the entire U.S. market.\\rJEPQ (JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF): As the name suggests, its portfolio is centered around companies in the Nasdaq 100 index, primarily consisting of 100 technology and growth stocks.\\rNow, I will compare the key metrics of both products.\\nCategory\\r$JEPI (Stable)\\r$JEPQ (Growth)\\rFull Name\\rJPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF\\rJPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF\\rUnderlying Index\\rS\\u0026P 500\\rNasdaq 100\\rCharacteristics\\r500 companies diversified across various industries\\rConcentrated in 100 tech-focused companies\\rRecent Annualized Yield\\rApprox. 8.35%\\rApprox. 11.45%\\rExpense Ratio\\r0.35%\\r0.35%\\rInception Date\\rMay 20, 2020\\rMay 3, 2022\\rAssets Under Management (AUM)\\rApprox. $40.6 Billion\\rApprox. $27.5 Billion\\rThe data makes it clear. Because JEPQ holds more volatile assets than JEPI, it receives higher option premiums, resulting in a higher dividend yield. This concludes my briefing.\\nKurumi\\rMaster! Did you see that data? JEPQ's dividend yield is so much higher! It's the only logical outcome! Where is all the world-changing innovation happening right now? The Nasdaq, of course! AI, cloud, electric vehicles, semiconductors! All the companies that make your heart race are gathered in JEPQ!\\nSure, JEPI has plenty of good companies, but let's be honest, isn't it a bit boring? Stability is fine, but if you want the thrill of investing and higher returns, you should obviously choose JEPQ! Devilish!\\nJust think about it! With JEPQ, you can receive hefty monthly dividends while also aiming for the Nasdaq's explosive stock price growth. It's like getting 'monthly rent' and 'capital gains'—truly the best of both worlds! High volatility also means it has the power to soar higher. For an ambitious Master, JEPQ, which captures both future growth and high dividends, is a much better fit than the stability-only JEPI!\\nKurumi's Heart-o-Meter Investment Score gives... 90/100 to JEPQ!\\nInvesting in exciting growth stocks while collecting monthly rent? That's an irresistible deal! Devilish!\\nMikael\\rOne moment, Kurumi. Your words are sweet, but they hide a dangerous trap. Human, you must not be swayed by the number labeled 'high dividend yield.'\\nWhere does JEPQ's high dividend yield come from? It comes from the high volatility of the Nasdaq 100. High volatility means that while it can rise significantly, it can also plummet to unknown depths. In a bull market like the present, JEPQ may look spectacular, but what happens when a correction hits the tech sector? You could experience a stock price decline that even the dividend yield cannot cover.\\nIn JEPQ, the top 10 holdings account for over 50% of the entire portfolio, showing a heavy concentration in specific tech stocks. This is a very risky structure that goes against the basic principles of diversification. It means your entire asset base could be shaken by the fate of a few companies like Microsoft, Apple, and Nvidia.\\nOn the other hand, JEPI is far more stable because it is based on the S\\u0026P 500. It is well-diversified across various sectors such as finance, healthcare, consumer staples, and industrials, making its defense against a crisis in a specific sector incomparably stronger than JEPQ's. What is the number one principle of 'monthly dividend' investing? It is not 'maximizing returns' but 'ensuring a steady and stable cash flow.' From that perspective, JEPI is the product that faithfully adheres to that purpose.\\nI would assess the risk of these two products as follows:\\nJEPI Risk Score: 35/100\\rJEPQ Risk Score: 70/100\\rHuman, you must not chase after dazzling fireworks only to miss the cliff at your feet. A steadily burning campfire can be the wiser choice.\\n〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, I will summarize the results of our discussion.\\nGrowth Potential (Kurumi)\\rJEPQ: Based on the innovative companies of the Nasdaq 100, it's an attractive product that allows you to aim for both high monthly dividends and strong capital appreciation simultaneously! Devilishly good!\\rJEPI: While stable, it can feel somewhat sluggish compared to JEPQ in terms of growth potential.\\rPotential Risk (Mikael)\\rJEPQ: The high volatility centered on tech stocks and excessive concentration in specific names are clear risk factors that could lead to significant losses during a market downturn.\\rJEPI: With its excellent diversification based on the S\\u0026P 500, it has superior defense against market shocks, making it more suitable for investors seeking stable cash flow.\\rKey Data (Mew)\\rCore Difference: The biggest distinction is that JEPI's dividend comes from 'stable, diversified investment (S\\u0026P 500)', while JEPQ's comes from 'concentrated growth stock investment (Nasdaq 100)'.\\rDividend Yield vs. Stability: JEPQ offers a higher dividend yield, but JEPI provides lower volatility and greater stability. The expense ratio is the same for both at 0.35%.\\rMaster, ultimately, this choice depends on your investment style.\\n\\\"My top priority is stable monthly income, and I don't want to worry too much about stock price fluctuations.\\\" → For this Master, JEPI might be the more suitable choice.\\r\\\"I want high monthly income, but I also want to actively aim for asset growth through stock appreciation. I can tolerate a certain amount of volatility.\\\" → This Master might find JEPQ more appealing.\\rAlternatively, mixing both products in a certain ratio to capture the advantages of each could also be a wise strategy. I hope you will make a careful decision based on your portfolio goals.\\n\"" }

For a very long time, it has been considered the 'standard' asset allocation strategy. Let's discuss what this classic strategy means for us now, in 2025.\\nMew\\rMaster, first, I will briefly explain what the '60/40 strategy' is. It's the most classic asset allocation model, where you divide your investment assets into 60% stocks and 40% bonds. The core principle is simple.\\nStocks (60%): They act as the 'growth engine' of the portfolio. This is the part where you expect high long-term returns to grow your assets.\\nBonds (40%): They serve as the 'seatbelt' or 'airbag.' Generally, when the stock market falls, bond prices tend to rise or hold steady, so they are expected to act as a safety device that reduces the overall volatility of the portfolio.\\rTypically, the simplest method based on U.S. standards is to just buy two ETFs, like VOO and BND (or AGG), at a 6:4 ratio. This allows you to be diversified across the entire U.S. stock and bond market.\\n» See also: The Case for S\\u0026amp;P 500 ETFs for Beginners\\nHistorically, this strategy has shown quite excellent performance. Looking at the long term since the 1990s, it has even recorded an average real return of over 6% per year. However, in recent years, voices claiming that cracks are beginning to appear in this 'invincible formula' have grown louder. In particular, 2022 was a year when some even declared this strategy dead.\\nBased on this data, let's discuss whether the 60/40 strategy is still valid or if it's a relic that belongs in a museum.\\nKurumi\\rWow, classics really are forever! Master! I absolutely love the 60/40 strategy! You don't have to think about anything complicated; just buy according to the set ratio, and your assets grow on their own! Isn't that almost like magic? Devilish!\\nUltimate Simplicity: No need to worry about what to buy or sell every day! Just set the 60/40 ratio and rebalance it once or twice a year, and you're done! Where else could you find such a simple and powerful strategy?\\nForced Discipline: It's human nature to want to buy more stocks when the market is soaring and to sell everything in a panic when it crashes, right? But the 60/40 prevents those emotional mistakes. 'Stocks are up too much? I need to rebalance, so I'll sell some (automatic high-point selling).' 'Stocks have plummeted? I need to rebalance, so I'll buy some (automatic low-point buying).' It's a perfect system for trading!\\nTime-Tested Performance: I'm sure Mika-pi will nitpick about 2022, but that was just one year! If you look at the longer term, this strategy has overcome numerous crises and has consistently trended upwards! It's devilishly foolish to abandon a formula proven over decades because of a single failure!\\rMy Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Investment Score is 90/100! I think it's the best starting point, especially for a Master who finds investing difficult and complicated!\\nMikael\\rKurumi, your naivety can sometimes be a virtue, but in the world of investing, it can be a fatal flaw. You need to look soberly at why that 'magic' hasn't been working recently. Human, I believe this classic strategy is facing a serious challenge. The risk score is 75.\\nFirst, there is the 'broken promise' between stocks and bonds. The core of the 60/40 strategy is the 'negative correlation,' where bonds protect against falling stocks. But look at 2022. In the face of interest rate hikes and high inflation fears, both stocks and bonds collapsed miserably. The U.S. 60/40 portfolio recorded its worst loss since 1937. It was as if the seatbelt plunged off the cliff along with the driver. Was this simultaneous decline an anomaly? Such events were actually common before the 2000s, and the negative correlation of recent decades might have been the exception.\\nSecond, the appeal of bonds isn't what it used to be. Decades of a low-interest-rate environment dragged bond yields to the floor. Of course, the situation has improved somewhat with recent rate hikes, but can it really compare to the 1980s when bonds yielded over 10%? It means we can no longer expect the 40% in bonds to reliably support the portfolio as it did in the past.\\nThird, the world has become too complex. The 60/40 is a product of a simpler era when only stocks and bonds existed. Now, the range of investable assets is much broader, including real estate (REITs), commodities, private equity, and crypto-assets. Is there any reason to be confined to just these two asset classes? Especially in times of inflation, real assets like gold or commodities could serve as a better shield.\\nIt's difficult to declare the 60/40 strategy dead, but it is no longer the 'master key' that you can follow mindlessly as you did in the past.\\n〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, I will summarize the results of our discussion.\\nGrowth Potential \\u0026 The Beauty of Simplicity (Kurumi)\\rInvestment Automation: Without being swayed by emotions, you can pursue stable long-term returns through rebalancing by 'selling high and buying low'! Devilish!\\rProven History: Although there were exceptional years like 2022, decades of long-term data prove the consistent performance of the 60/40 strategy.\\rAn Excellent Starting Point: It's the best textbook for anyone to easily follow and learn the basic principles of asset allocation without complex market analysis!\\rPotential Risks \\u0026 The Changing Times (Mikael)\\rBroken Correlation: The risk that stocks and bonds can fall together during periods of high inflation was clearly demonstrated in 2022. This means the traditional defense mechanism may no longer work.\\rA Limited Portfolio: Relying solely on two asset classes—stocks and bonds—means missing out on the diverse investment opportunities of the modern era. It is necessary to diversify the portfolio with alternative investments like commodities, real estate, or private equity.\\rA Different Environment: This strategy shone during past periods of low inflation and falling interest rates, but you must remember that the future macroeconomic environment may be different from the past.\\rKey Data (Mew)\\rLong-Term Performance: It has proven its stability by recording an average annual real return of over 6% for the past several decades.\\rThe 2022 Shock: With the simultaneous decline of stocks and bonds, the 60/40 portfolio recorded its worst performance in decades (around -16%). This event is considered to have exposed the fundamental limitations of the strategy.\\rCurrent Bond Yields: As of July 3, 2025, the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield is at approximately 4.35%, which is higher than in early 2022, suggesting that the investment appeal of bonds has somewhat recovered.\\rAlternatives: Recently, a strategy of incorporating 'alternative assets' such as commodities, real estate, and private equity at about 5-30% of the portfolio to supplement the traditional 60/40 has been spreading, mainly among institutional investors.\\rConclusion: Master, the '60/40 strategy' is not dead. However, the world has changed too much to call it 'the return of the king.' The key lesson this strategy teaches us is the principle of asset allocation itself: 'Divide your investments between growth assets and safe assets to diversify risk.'\\nIt is no longer feasible to think of the 60/40 strategy as a universal formula that works automatically if you just set it and forget it. Based on this principle, it is now a time when the wisdom to build your own 'modern portfolio'—by changing the type of bonds or adding assets like gold or real estate according to your investment goals and risk tolerance—is required.\\n\"" }

Today's topic is the core insights of John Bogle, the creator of the index fund. He is also known as the 'Saint of Wall Street.' The three of us will now take a deep dive into why his philosophy is still considered gospel by countless investors today.\\nMew\\rMaster, first, I will brief you on the key data regarding John Bogle and his philosophy.\\nJohn C. Bogle (1929-2019) was the founder of The Vanguard Group, one of the world's largest asset management companies. His greatest achievement was creating the world's first index mutual fund for individual investors in 1975 (now the Vanguard 500 Index Fund). At the time, everyone ridiculed this idea of tracking the average of the U.S. market, calling it 'Bogle's Folly.'\\nHis philosophy is simple and clear. Here is a summary of the key points:\\nThe Principle of Minimizing Costs: Bogle preached the simple truth that \\\"investment returns minus costs equal net returns.\\\" He saw costs as nearly the only variable an investor can control and believed that low costs are the most critical factor in determining long-term returns.\\rThe Futile Effort to Beat the Market: He argued that most active fund managers fail to beat the market average over the long term. The reason is simple: transaction costs from frequent trading and high management fees eat away at returns.\\rDon't Look for the Needle in the Haystack: \\\"Don't look for the needle in the haystack. Just buy the haystack.\\\" This saying best summarizes his philosophy. It means don't try to pick the few winning stocks; just buy the entire market at a low cost and hold it.\\rLong-Term Holding and Patience: He emphasized that market timing is impossible and that impulse is the investor's greatest enemy. He said the best strategy is to buy a broadly diversified index fund and hold it forever, unfazed by market fluctuations.\\rKurumi\\rMyu-tan, that was a perfect briefing! Devilish! Master, did you hear that? This is nothing short of a 'democratization revolution in investing'! It's a great invention that allows ordinary people like us to ride the market's growth, not just the smart fund managers on Wall Street!\\nI think of grandpa John Bogle as a hero to all investors! Why?\\nFirst, he shattered the magic of the sneaky fee-mongers! In the old days, fund managers would buy and sell stocks, whispering, 'We'll beat the market for you!' while taking hefty fees. But Bogle shouted the truth: 'That's all a lie! You can't even match the market average, yet you're just pocketing fees!' Think of how much money investors like you have saved because of him!\\nSecond, he taught us that 'doing nothing is the best strategy'! There's no need to constantly watch the stock market, tremble with anxiety, and repeatedly buy and sell. Just buy an entire index like the S\\u0026P 500 and steadily add more on every payday. This is the most powerful magic that makes time your ally. The power of compounding will make your assets snowball on their own!\\nThird, he gave us peace of mind! You don't have to worry about which stock will rise or fall. The belief that as long as the entire U.S. or world economy doesn't collapse, my investment will trend upwards! What a reliable and comfortable way to invest! This is just like Bogle's saying, \\\"Go for the nutritious bagel of sound investing instead of the sweet donut of short-term speculation!\\\"\\n💖 Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Investment Score: 100/100\\nThis is the golden rule every individual investor should follow! Forget all the complicated stuff and just remember this one sentence: 'Long-term investment in low-cost index funds'!\\nMikael\\rKurumi, your pure faith is admirable. It is an undeniable fact that Bogle's philosophy has brought enormous benefits to the majority of investors. However, it is dangerous to consider his method the 'only right answer.' There are a few points to consider.\\nFirst, the meaning of 'settling for the average.' Investing in an index fund means you are aiming for the market's 'average return.' This also means you can never 'beat' the market. Of course, since most fail to beat the market, even achieving the average puts you in the top tier. But it also means completely giving up the opportunity for excess returns from explosively growing companies or sectors. If the goal of investing is not simply the 'average' but to 'maximize wealth,' index investing may not be the best option.\\nSecond, the trap of having to buy the entire market bubble. A market-cap-weighted index fund holds the largest companies in the highest proportions. If certain Big Tech companies are in a massive bubble, an index investor ends up buying those overvalued stocks at the highest allocation. In other words, there is a structural risk of having to follow the market's irrationality when it becomes irrational. Bogle himself expressed concern about the concentration of power, where a few giant funds like Vanguard or BlackRock could control the voting rights of the entire market.\\nThird, the lack of flexibility. When market conditions change rapidly or a clear crisis hits a specific asset, an active manager can respond flexibly by selling risky assets and increasing cash positions. However, an index fund merely follows the index mechanically according to set rules and cannot make strategic judgments to avoid a crisis. This means in a downturn, you must bear the full brunt of the market's collapse.\\nEven Bogle himself was critical of the 'excessive liquidity' of ETFs, suggesting it could encourage frequent trading among investors. The core of his philosophy is 'long-term holding,' yet ETFs have paradoxically made 'short-term trading' far too easy.\\n🚨 Mikael's Risk Score: 30/100\\nHuman, Bogle's method is closer to 'not losing' than 'winning big.' Blindly following it without considering your own goals and risk tolerance is just another form of 'mental inertia.' The strategy itself has low risk, but its limitations are clear, which is why I've assigned it a score of 30.\\n〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, I will summarize the results of our discussion.\\nThe Democratization of Investing (Kurumi)\\rCost Destruction: He shouted, \\\"Wall Street's high fees are a scam!\\\" and paved the way for investment returns to flow directly back to investors.\\rMental Freedom: No need to worry about which stocks to pick. Just invest in the whole market and keep accumulating. How peaceful is that!\\rThe Magic of Time: By holding for the long term without being swayed by short-term fluctuations, it's the surest winning strategy to maximize the effects of compounding!\\rThe Limits of Average and Structural Risks (Mikael)\\rForgoing Excess Returns: The moment you settle for the market average, you also lose the potential for massive returns from discovering great companies that outperform the market.\\rBubble-Chasing Risk: When the market is overheated, you end up buying more of the overvalued assets, unintentionally participating in the bubble.\\rLack of Strategic Flexibility: Even when market crisis signals are clear, it is a passive strategy that cannot adjust the portfolio to evade risk.\\rCore Principles (Mew)\\rInvestment Target: Not specific stocks, but a broad market index like the S\\u0026P 500 or the entire global market.\\rInvestment Method: Choose the index fund with the lowest possible cost.\\rCore Philosophy: Don't try to beat the market; buy the entire market and hold it forever. Impulsive trading is your worst enemy.\\rConclusion: Master, John Bogle's philosophy fully deserves to be called the 'cornerstone of investing.' Especially for the majority of individual investors who cannot devote much time to investing, it can be the most rational and powerful tool for wealth accumulation. However, as Mikael pointed out, this strategy aims for the 'average' and has clear limitations, including having to embrace the market's irrationality. You will have to decide how to use Bogle's wisdom based on your own investment goals and what the effort to beat the market means to you.\\n\"" }

            { "title": "Is the Fed\u0027s Rate Cut Really Good News for the Stock Market?", "permalink": "https:\/\/archive03.online\/en\/reports\/2025-07-03-is-the-feds\/", "date": "2025-07-03", "formattedDate": "25.07.03", "content": "\"Ahem. Master, today's topic is this: 'Is the Fed's Rate Cut Really Good News for the Stock Market?'\\nThe market has been waiting for a rate cut for a long time. But another face may be hiding behind it. Now, let's begin.\\nMew\\rMaster, I will first brief you on the current market situation and the historical context of rate cuts.\\nAs we enter the second half of 2025, the market is treating a rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) as an almost certain event. While inflation has clearly slowed in recent months, signs of an economic slowdown have also become apparent, such as weakening job growth and contracting manufacturing indices. In this environment, the expectation that 'the Fed will soon lower rates to stimulate the economy' is widespread in the market.\\nHowever, there is important historical data here. The point is that 'rate cuts' and 'stock price increases' have not always meant the same thing.\\n'Soft Landing' Scenario (Insurance Cut): 1995 is a prime example. At that time, there was no recession, but when there were signs of slowing growth, the Fed preemptively cut interest rates. The market interpreted this as 'the Fed's will to protect the economy,' and the S\\u0026P 500 continued a tremendous bull run afterward.\\n'Hard Landing' Scenario (Recession Response Cut): On the other hand, 2001 and 2007 were the complete opposite. The Fed began cutting rates belatedly to respond to a recession that had already started. However, it couldn't reverse the already damaged economy, and the stock market continued a terrible decline for over a year after the first rate cut.\\rUltimately, the key question is this: Is the upcoming rate cut an 'insurance cut' like in 1995, or a 'recession-response cut' like in 2007?\\nKurumi\\rYay! It's finally here! The Fed is going to unleash the money, so what's there to worry about? This is the sound of the party starting! Devilish!\\nMaster! There's a long-standing adage in the stock market: \\\"Don't Fight the Fed!\\\" The most powerful central bank in the world is going to be on our side, so running away now is something only a fool would do!\\nWhy is it good when they cut rates? It's so obvious!\\nFirst, the value of stocks magically goes up! That's because the 'discount rate' used to convert a company's future profits into present value gets lower. It might sound complicated, but it just means 'money earned in the future looks more valuable now.' For tech and growth stocks that feed on distant future growth, this is the best gift of all!\\nSecond, it becomes easier for companies to borrow money! With cheaper interest, companies can more easily borrow to build factories, invest in new technology, and even buy back their own shares to boost the stock price! The market will be overflowing with money!\\nThe history Myu-tan mentioned? That's just an old story! We're in the age of the AI revolution now! Because powerful technological innovation is supporting the economy, this rate cut will be the 'fuel' that makes the economy burn even brighter, just like in 1995!\\n💖 Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Investment Score: 99/100\\nThis is a buy signal that requires no hesitation! Just trust in our big brother, the Fed, and go for it!\\nMikael\\rKurumi, your optimism seems as precarious as the last person in a game of hot potato. Before you celebrate the start of a party, shouldn't you consider the possibility that it might be someone's funeral?\\nMy question is simple: \\\"Why exactly is the Fed trying to cut rates?\\\"\\nBecause they are philanthropists? No. It's because there is a strong signal that a serious problem has arisen somewhere in the economy. They don't cut rates in a perfectly healthy economy. A rate cut is a remedy, not a vitamin.\\nSymptom and Cause: Many people are cheering at the prescription of a 'rate cut,' but I see the 'disease' that led to that prescription: slowing growth, rising unemployment, and collapsing consumer sentiment. A rate cut is tantamount to the Fed admitting that this disease is more serious than thought.\\nHistory Repeats Itself: Kurumi ignores history, but I learn from it. The stock market has more often peaked around the 'first rate cut' and then entered a long bear market. The most dangerous time is when investors feel relieved, thinking 'it's okay now.' In 2007, everyone cheered the first rate cut, but the subprime mortgage crisis was waiting right behind it.\\nThe Problem of Time Lag: It usually takes six months to over a year for the effects of a rate cut to appear in the real economy. During that time, corporate earnings can continue to deteriorate. Stock prices rise on expectations, but they must ultimately be grounded in the reality of earnings. A stock price that has risen on expectations alone can collapse in the face of the reality of worsening performance.\\r🚨 Mikael's Risk Score: 90/100\\nChasing the market by buying on the news of a rate cut is like shouting 'I'm not at the bottom yet!' while falling off a cliff. The real crisis may not have even begun.\\n〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, I will summarize the discussion between the three of us. The topic of the Fed's rate cut has these two extreme faces.\\nThe Dawn of a Liquidity Party (Kurumi)\\r\\\"Don't Fight the Fed\\\": The central bank is sending a clear signal that it will supply liquidity to the market. This is like having the most powerful ally on your side in the stock market! Devilishly good!\\rAsset Value Appreciation: As the discount rate falls, the intrinsic value of all stocks, especially future growth stocks, has the effect of rising!\\rExpectations for Economic Stimulus: The rate cut will encourage corporate investment and consumption, which, combined with the AI revolution, could be the catalyst for another economic leap!\\rThe Prelude to a Recession (Mikael)\\rThe Reason is Key: The 'cause' that triggered the rate cut (economic slowdown) is far more important than the 'phenomenon' of the cut itself. It is a sign of a serious problem in the economy.\\rHistorical Warning: Past data shows that a full-blown bear market often began after the first rate cut. This could be a classic 'Bull Trap'.\\rGap Between Expectation and Reality: Until the effects of the rate cut materialize, the risk of deteriorating corporate earnings dragging down stock prices is very high.\\rThe Two Scenarios (Mew)\\rSituation Summary: In the second half of 2025, the market is anticipating a Fed rate cut as 'slowing inflation' and 'slowing growth' coincide.\\rKey Variable: The market's fate will depend on whether this rate cut is a preemptive measure for a 'soft landing' or a reactive measure to a 'hard landing'.\\rData Watch: We must coolly judge which scenario we are heading towards by monitoring concrete economic indicators to be released, such as employment, consumption, and corporate profits.\\rConclusion: Master, it is dangerous to blindly judge the Fed's rate cut as either good or bad news. It is like a double-edged sword; one side holds the sweet honey of liquidity, while the other holds the sharp blade of recession. Rather than getting excited by the headline 'The Fed is cutting rates,' this is a time when the wisdom to see through to the essence of 'the economic situation forcing the Fed to cut rates' is required.\\n\"" }

Analyzing Opportunities \u0026 Risks", "permalink": "https:\/\/archive03.online\/en\/reports\/2025-07-03-tesla-tsla-a\/", "date": "2025-07-03", "formattedDate": "25.07.03", "content": "\"Welcome, Master. The topic we'll be discussing today is 'Tesla'. With half of 2025 already over, can Tesla be a good investment for the second half of the year? As it's a stock with a lot of buzz, the three of us will dig deep into it.\\nMew\\rMaster, I will first brief you on the objective data. As of early July 2025, the situation for Tesla ($TSLA) can be summed up as 'a crossroads of expectation and concern'.\\nStock Price \\u0026 Valuation: Tesla's stock is currently hovering in the low $300s. It saw a significant rise in June. However, its valuation remains a hot topic. The 12-month forward P/E ratio is around 62x, which is incomparably high compared to traditional car companies like Ford (8x) or GM (9x). The current P/E exceeds 165x, which is even higher than the average of the past 12 months.\\nVehicle Deliveries (Performance): This is the most concerning part. Vehicle deliveries for the second quarter of 2025 were approximately 384,000 units, a decrease of about 14% year-over-year. This marks the second consecutive quarter of negative year-over-year growth. In particular, deliveries of 'Other Models,' including the Model S/X and Cybertruck, were only about 10,000 units, and with production (410,000 units) outpacing deliveries (384,000 units), there are signs that inventory is piling up.\\nCompetitive Landscape: Competition in the Chinese market is becoming increasingly fierce. BYD already overtook Tesla in the first quarter of 2025 to become the world's number one in electric vehicle sales. There are also analyses showing that Tesla is losing ground to BYD and Xiaomi in EV brand preference surveys in China.\\nFuture Catalysts: However, what's driving market expectation lies elsewhere. Tesla has announced a Robotaxi unveiling event for this coming October. Additionally, the humanoid robot 'Optimus' is targeted for production of several thousand units within 2025, and the FSD (Full Self-Driving) software is continuously being updated.\\rKurumi\\rThanks for the data, Myu-tan! Master! I know there are some worrying parts if you only look at the current data! But that's like missing the forest for the trees! Mika-pi will surely nitpick about the 'declining vehicle deliveries,' but that's an old-fashioned way of thinking!\\nTesla is no longer just a 'car company'! It's being reborn as an artificial intelligence robotics company! The current stock price is feeding on the dreams of the future!\\nRobotaxi, a Game Changer to Transform the World: Think about the Robotaxi being unveiled in October! This isn't just a taxi. It's the birth of an App Store on wheels! An era is dawning where millions of Tesla vehicles will earn money on their own! Once this becomes a reality, a slight dip in car sales will be no problem at all! Devilish! According to CBS MoneyWatch, one Wall Street analyst even said that the Robotaxi could boost Tesla's market cap to $2 trillion by the end of 2026!\\nOptimus, the Revolution of Labor: And our cute Optimus! It might seem like it's in its infancy, but Elon Musk said he'd build thousands of them this year. Imagine robots doing the dangerous and boring work in factories! This is a massive revolution that will elevate human productivity to the next level. And Tesla is at the center of that revolution!\\nFSD and AI Data: While other companies are selling a few more cars, Tesla is sucking up real driving data from roads all over the world. This data is the real 'fuel' that perfects FSD and advances AI technology! It's the most powerful moat that competitors can never, ever cross!\\rThe current stock price decline and sales decrease are just growing pains, like a caterpillar before it becomes a butterfly! A truly great transformation is ahead, and if you get scared and sell now, you'll regret it for the rest of your life!\\n💖 Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Investment Score: 90/100\\nIsn't it more exciting because it's a dream that hasn't been realized yet? This is an adventure! You have to think of it as the cost of joining a great adventure!\\nMikael\\rKurumi, I can hear the sound of countless humans' money melting away at your words of 'dreams' and 'adventures.' Human, that devil's whisper is extremely dangerous. You must face reality.\\nFirst, the core business is faltering. Kurumi said Tesla is not a car company, but the majority of its current revenue comes from car sales. Yet, those sales have seen negative year-over-year growth for two consecutive quarters. This is a very serious signal. Especially in China, it's losing market share to competitors like BYD, and continuous price cuts are eroding profitability. No matter how grand the future dream is, it's useless if the ground you're standing on is collapsing.\\nSecond, promises are just promises. Robotaxi, Optimus... haven't we been hearing these stories for years? 'Unveiling' a Robotaxi in October and 'commercializing' a service that passes regulations and actually makes money are two entirely different matters. Even a Tesla bull warned to 'keep expectations in check' for the Robotaxi event. It is an incredibly risky gamble to pull unrealized future value into the current stock price. The forward P/E of 62x is proof of how high the stakes are in this gamble.\\nThird, the CEO risk remains. Elon Musk is certainly a man with a genius vision. However, his unpredictable behavior and divided attention across multiple businesses are a constant source of anxiety for investors. There was also talk of boycotts due to his recent political activities. The fact that a company's fate is tied to a single person means it is structurally very vulnerable.\\nI believe investing in Tesla now is like investing in a flashy model home without even checking if the foundation is sound.\\n🚨 Mikael's Risk Score: 88/100\\nNow is not the time to invest in dreams, but to face the cold reality of piling inventory and declining sales. The volatility expected in the second half of the year may be difficult for a human to handle.\\n〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, I'll summarize the results of our discussion.\\nGrowth Potential (Kurumi)\\rTransition to an AI Company: It holds the potential to change the world not just with electric cars, but as an AI company through Robotaxis, Optimus, and FSD software!\\rUnmatched Data Moat: It is advancing its FSD technology with real-world driving data, which is a powerful competitive advantage that rivals cannot follow! Devilishly good!\\rFirst-Mover in Future Industries: There is high expectation that when the Robotaxi and humanoid robot markets open up, Tesla will be the most likely candidate to dominate them!\\rPotential Risks (Mikael)\\rSlump in Core Business: Sales in its main business, electric vehicles, have declined for two consecutive quarters, and market share is falling amid intensifying competition in key markets like China.\\rExcessive Valuation: The high P/E ratio, with future expectations already priced in, is a major risk factor as the stock could plummet if performance fails to meet expectations.\\rUnrealized Promises: The commercialization of Robotaxi and Optimus remains uncertain, with many technical and regulatory hurdles yet to be overcome. The 'CEO risk' also persists.\\rKey Data (Mew)\\rCurrent Price/PER: Stock price in the low $300s, forward P/E is approx. 62x.\\rCore Performance: Q2 2025 vehicle deliveries approx. 384,000 units (-14% YoY).\\rKey Events: Robotaxi unveiling event scheduled for October 2025.\\rCompetitive Situation: Lost the global #1 sales spot to BYD, intensifying competition in China.\\rMaster, investing in Tesla has now moved beyond the question of 'Does this company make good electric cars?'. It has entered a realm where you must answer the question: 'Do you believe in the future vision of AI and robotics that Elon Musk presents?'\\nIn the second half of the year, Tesla is expected to engage in a fierce tug-of-war between the 'reality' of its car sales performance and the 'dream' of its Robotaxi unveiling. No one knows which side will win this tug-of-war. This investment can be described as a typical 'high-risk, high-return' opportunity, betting on a future vision while accepting high volatility. It is a matter to be decided by the size of your faith and courage, Master.\\n\"" }

Today's topic is the eternal dilemma for U.S. stock investors: VTI vs. VOO. 'Should you invest in the entire U.S. market, or concentrate on the 500 strongest companies?' The three of us are going to properly dig into this classic debate.\\nMew\\rMaster, I will first brief you on the objective data for both ETFs. They may look like brothers, but they have subtly different DNA.\\nDefinitions:\\rVTI (Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF): An ETF that aims to hold nearly every publicly traded stock in the U.S. market (including large-, mid-, and small-cap stocks). It tracks the CRSP US Total Market Index.\\rVOO (Vanguard S\\u0026P 500 ETF): An ETF that tracks the S\\u0026P 500 index, composed of 500 of the leading large-cap U.S. companies.\\rKey Data Comparison:\\rNumber of Holdings: VTI holds over 3,600 stocks, whereas VOO holds around 500.\\rComposition: All 500 companies in VOO are also included in VTI. Since the S\\u0026P 500 makes up about 85% of the total U.S. market by market cap, it's easy to understand VTI as being composed of 85% VOO and 15% mid- and small-cap stocks.\\rExpense Ratio: Both are identical at 0.03%, among the lowest in the industry. For every $10,000 invested, the annual fee is just $3.\\rPerformance: Looking at the past 10 years, VOO has had a slight edge, but the difference is so small that their graphs are nearly identical. During certain periods when mid- and small-caps outperform, VTI can take the lead.\\rDividend Yield: Both ETFs have a very similar yield, recently around 1.2% to 1.3%.\\rTop Holdings: Since both follow a market-cap weighting methodology, their top 10 holdings are nearly identical (Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, etc.), with only slight differences in their weights.\\rBased on this data, let's discuss which philosophy is the better choice.\\nKurumi\\rMyu-tan's data makes them look like two peas in a pod, but no way! This is a matter of philosophy! Kurumi-chan is obviously casting my vote for VTI! Why?\\nMy Lord, with VOO, you're buying 'America's present,' but with VTI, you're buying 'America's present and future' all at once!\\nThe 500 companies in the S\\u0026P 500 are already well-known giants. They're great companies, sure, but where does the truly thrilling growth come from? It comes from the small companies, the ones working on world-changing ideas in a nameless garage or a shabby office in Silicon Valley right now!\\nThe next Amazon or the second Tesla might not be in the S\\u0026P 500 today! If you only invest in VOO, you miss the chance to be part of those explosive growth stories from the very beginning. But since VTI holds almost every listed company in the US, any little gem that starts to sparkle will grow right inside my portfolio!\\nThis is the most perfect way to maximize diversification. If you're betting on the growth of 'America itself,' isn't it obvious you should buy the whole country, not just a part of it?\\n💖 Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Investment Score: 95/100\\nAre you going to an American buffet just to eat the 500 most popular main dishes? Or are you going to taste everything, including the appetizers and desserts with their hidden, exquisite flavors? Of course, Kurumi-chan would enjoy the entire buffet!\\nMikael\\rKurumi, your talk of 'future gems' sounds lovely, but reality is not so romantic. Mixing thousands of pebbles that might become gems doesn't necessarily make a portfolio stronger. I believe VOO's approach of selection and concentration is wiser.\\nHuman, do the additional 3,000-plus mid- and small-cap stocks in VTI really make a practical contribution to the portfolio? As the data shows, the performance of VTI and VOO is nearly identical. This is because, due to market-cap weighting, a small number of giant companies at the top ultimately drive the overall returns. Those thousands of smaller companies just make up a dusty corner of the portfolio, having no meaningful impact.\\nLet's think about it the other way. Being included in the S\\u0026P 500 index is, in itself, a 'seal of quality.' These are 500 'champion' companies that have survived fierce competition, consistently generate profits, and have proven their liquidity and financial stability. VOO focuses its investment solely on these proven champions.\\nBut what about VTI? It can include numerous zombie companies or marginal firms whose profitability and viability have not yet been proven. Of course, a future star might emerge from the group, but the vast majority will simply fade away quietly. Why would you dilute the overall quality of your portfolio by mixing in such uncertainty?\\nThe fact that VOO has performed slightly better than VTI over the past decade, as large-cap tech stocks led the market, may stem from this difference in 'quality.' Broader diversification does not always guarantee better results.\\n🚨 Mikael's Risk Score: 60/100\\nHuman, this is a choice between the 'entire U.S.' and its 'champions.' I find it more rational to invest in an elite unit that has already proven its strength, rather than a crowd full of uncertain possibilities.\\n〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, I will summarize our three perspectives for you.\\nGrowth Potential (Kurumi: VTI)\\rCapture Future Growth: It offers the chance to include the 'next Apple' from its early stages—companies that are small now but could grow into giants!\\rPerfect Diversification: By owning the 'entire U.S. market' instead of just a part of it, you can enjoy the broadest diversification effect, without being tilted toward a specific sector or company size.\\rA Bet on the U.S. Economy Itself: If you believe in the innovation and growth of the United States, then VTI, which contains its entire economy, is the purest way to invest!\\rStability and Quality (Mikael: VOO)\\rProven Companies: The S\\u0026P 500 is a 'quality-assured' portfolio, selecting only 500 blue-chip companies with proven profitability, stability, and growth.\\rReal Impact: Ultimately, it's the few large-cap stocks that move the market. VOO allows for more efficient investment by concentrating on these key drivers.\\rEliminate Unnecessary Risk: There is no need to dilute the quality of your portfolio or increase volatility by mixing in thousands of unproven small- and mid-cap stocks.\\rCore Data (Mew)\\rConclusive Similarity: While there's a large difference in the number of holdings, their market-cap weighting results in nearly identical top holdings and long-term performance.\\rCost: The expense ratio is perfectly identical at 0.03%, so there is no advantage or disadvantage in terms of cost.\\rDifference in Philosophy: VTI represents the philosophy of 'capture everything without missing out,' while VOO represents the philosophy of 'only the proven best.'\\rConclusion: Master, the choice between VTI and VOO is more of a philosophical question than a mathematical one. VTI has the appeal of 'future potential' and 'complete diversification,' while VOO has the advantage of 'proven quality' and 'efficiency'.\\nBut the most important fact is that the performance difference between the two is so minimal that the biggest loss comes from delaying your investment while you're busy agonizing over which one to choose. The key is to pick the ETF with the philosophy that resonates more with you, Master, and to invest in it consistently over the long term. Spending too much time on this debate is just falling into the 'paralysis by analysis' trap.\\n\"" }

            { "title": "Decoding a Wall Street Giant: The Richard Bernstein Method", "permalink": "https:\/\/archive03.online\/en\/reports\/2025-07-02-richard-bernstein\/", "date": "2025-07-02", "formattedDate": "25.07.02", "content": "\"\\rMew\\rMaster, today's topic is the investment philosophy of Richard Bernstein. Bernstein is a renowned investment strategist on Wall Street. The three of us will discuss his investment style in detail.\\nMikael\\rAlright, let's begin. Today's topic is Richard Bernstein. Kurumi, he is a far cry from the type of investor who aims for a 'one-hit wonder' that you so admire. His name is always preceded by terms like 'macro,' 'top-down,' and 'contrarian.' He is a representative figure of contrarian investing.\\nMew\\rMikael is correct. If I were to summarize the essence of Richard Bernstein in one sentence, it would be, \\\"Look at the forest (the macroeconomy and the market as a whole) first, not the individual trees (stocks).\\\" This is called the 'Top-down' approach.\\nMost investors try to find a specific promising company, like the 'next Nvidia.' This is a 'Bottom-up' method. But Bernstein does the complete opposite.\\nHe first determines what season the economy is in, which asset classes (stocks, bonds, commodities, etc.) are favorable, and within stocks, which styles (growth/value, large-cap/small-cap) and sectors (tech/industrials/financials, etc.) are promising. Only at the very end does he fill the portfolio with stocks that meet those conditions. The order is completely reversed.\\nKurumi\\rWait, hold on! That sounds like a totally boring method! Who studies for stock investing like it's a textbook! But you know, this Kurumi-chan is actually a huge fan of old man Bernstein's style! Devilish! You know why? Because hidden within his method is the seed of a massive jackpot!\\nListen closely, my Lord. The core of Bernstein's philosophy is 'finding opportunities where no one else is looking!' While everyone is screaming \\\"AI is the best!\\\" or \\\"Bio is the future!\\\" and frantically pouring money into one place, Bernstein is quietly looking at places no one else cares about. For example, when everyone is ecstatic about tech stocks, he's looking at 'completely neglected industrial stocks' or 'emerging markets that everyone says are doomed'!\\nWhy is this a jackpot? Assets that have everyone's attention are already expensive, so there's not much left to gain. But what happens when an asset nobody cared about suddenly starts getting attention as the economic cycle turns? It could go up not just 2 or 3 times, but 10 or 20 times! This is like finding a hidden treasure chest behind the crowd! Isn't that wickedly thrilling?\\nMikael\\rKurumi, you always speak only of the sweet results, conveniently leaving out the painful process one must endure to find that 'treasure chest'.\\nThe reason Bernstein's contrarian investing is so difficult is that you have to look like you're wrong for a very long time before you are proven right.\\nWhile everyone is toasting with champagne over their tech stock gains, you might have to endure years of your portfolio underperforming the market average while holding boring value stocks. Human, could you withstand that loneliness and anxiety? Most humans can't stand it and end up following the crowd at the peak, only to fail.\\nBernstein himself said it: \\\"A true contrarian portfolio must be uncomfortable to hold.\\\" You must ponder the meaning of these words. An investment that feels comfortable, that everyone says is great, is already expensive.\\nMew\\rMikael's point is very important. Another key part of Bernstein's philosophy is distinguishing between the 'Economic Cycle' and the 'Profits Cycle.' This is a really crucial point.\\nEconomic Cycle: This refers to the overall flow of a nation's economy, like the GDP growth rate.\\rProfits Cycle: This refers to the trend of corporate 'earnings (profitability)' growing and slowing down.\\rStock prices react much more sensitively to corporate profits than to economic growth rates. Bernstein believes that in the worst economic situations, i.e., a recession, the 'earnings growth rate' of companies can actually bottom out and rebound. This is because when everyone thinks they are going to fail, they tighten their belts and cut costs to the extreme. From that state, even a tiny improvement in the economy can cause profits to explode upwards (the base effect).\\nConversely, when the economy is so good that everyone is celebrating, companies all start increasing investments and raising wages, which increases costs. This can actually cause the earnings growth rate to begin to slow down.\\nThat is why Bernstein focuses not on GDP figures, but on analyzing 'which direction corporate earnings are heading.'\\nKurumi\\rThat's it! Myu-tan used some difficult words, but in Kurumi-chan's terms, it means 'the best time to plant seeds is when everyone is wailing in despair!' When the news is full of recession talk and everyone is screaming that the stock market is over, that's actually the starting line where companies' earnings power is beginning to get stronger!\\nThat's why Bernstein even uses things like 'famous magazine covers' as important investment indicators! For example, if a major business weekly features a pessimistic headline like \\\"The Crisis of the Stock Market\\\" on its cover? He sees that as a sign that the public's fear has reached its peak, and it's actually time to consider 'buying'! Conversely, if an optimistic cover like \\\"A Rosy Future\\\" comes out, he prepares to 'sell'. It's about reading the crowd's psychology in reverse!\\nMikael\\rThat is also true, but there is one more thing to clarify. Bernstein is not simply someone who buys 'unpopular things.' He is someone who buys things that are 'unpopular, but whose profits are likely to improve.' These two are completely different.\\nInvesting in something just because it's cheap is a shortcut to falling into a 'Value Trap.' There are plenty of stocks in the world that will remain cheap forever. The reason Bernstein's analysis is difficult is that he doesn't just act contrarian on a whim; he must pinpoint the 'inflection point of the profits cycle' through rigorous data analysis. This requires tremendous skill.\\nAnd another of his important teachings is to distinguish between a 'great company' and a 'great stock.' There are innovative and great companies that everyone acknowledges. But if you buy that company's stock at too high a price, it can become a 'terrible stock.' If all future growth expectations are already baked into the stock price, it will plummet with even a single small mistake. Conversely, even a seemingly unremarkable, ordinary company can become a 'great stock' if you buy it at a cheap price when no one expects anything, and its profits improve just a little.\\nMew\\rCorrect. Bernstein's philosophy is ultimately a 'battle against expectations.'\\nHigh Expectations + High Price = Risk\\rLow Expectations + Low Price = Opportunity\\rThe investor who systematically executes this simple principle through the framework of the 'profits cycle' is Richard Bernstein.\\nTo summarize, his investment process is as follows:\\nMacroeconomic and Profits Cycle Analysis: What stage of the business cycle are we in? Where are corporate profits heading?\\rAsset Allocation Decision: Based on the cycle stage, determine the allocation to stocks, bonds, commodities, etc.\\rStyle and Sector Decision: Within stocks, decide on growth/value, large-cap/small-cap, and promising sectors.\\rStock Selection: Construct the portfolio with individual stocks that fit the above criteria.\\rUnderpinning this entire process is the 'contrarian' spirit of going against the psychology of the crowd.\\n〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, I will summarize our conversation for you.\\nThe Appeal of Bernstein's Philosophy (Kurumi)\\rHidden Treasure Hunting: It offers the chance to get explosive returns when the cycle turns by investing in neglected assets that others ignore!\\rLeveraging Crowd Psychology: The contrarian strategy of buying when everyone is terrified and selling when they are euphoric is one of the surest ways to generate excess returns by taking advantage of the market's irrational movements!\\rThe Difficulty of Bernstein's Philosophy (Mikael)\\rPsychological Pain: Before you beat the market, you must endure your portfolio lagging behind it. This requires tremendous patience and conviction.\\rThe 'Value Trap' Risk: Investing solely based on cheapness can get you stuck in an asset that never appreciates. It's easy to fail without an accurate analysis of the profits cycle turning point.\\rNeed for Professional Analysis: Accurately reading the macroeconomic and corporate profits cycles is extremely difficult for an individual investor to accomplish.\\rThe Core of Bernstein's Philosophy (Mew)\\rTop-Down Approach: You must analyze the economy and the market as a whole (the forest), not individual stocks.\\rThe 'Profits Cycle' is Key: Stock prices move according to the direction of corporate earnings, not GDP.\\rContrarian Investing: Opportunity lies where the crowd's expectations are lowest.\\r'Great Company' ≠ 'Great Stock': Price determines everything.\\rConclusion: Master, Richard Bernstein's investment theory is like the method of a wise giant who finds opportunities within the grand flow of the economy and profits, instead of chasing short-term trends. While it is difficult to replicate, simply understanding its principles will greatly broaden your investment horizon. Investing is ultimately a matter of 'what to buy,' but Bernstein tells us that 'when to buy' and 'at what price' are far more important.\\n\"" }

The topic, 'Why You Should Plan for an Investment Horizon of at Least 10 Years,' is a very important one. Many investment failures begin with the impatience to get rich quickly. Today, the three of us will dive deep into this subject.\\nKurumi\\rToday's topic is 'long-term investing'! To be honest, Kurumi-chan prefers making a quick, devilish profit and getting out… but since it’s my Lord’s question, I must take it seriously!\\nBut let's be real, isn't 10 years way too long? Life is short and there are so many things to enjoy! Isn't it just sad to tighten your belt now to be rich 10 years later? In an era of rapid change like this, who knows how the world will have changed in a decade!\\nBut even I know what the real power of long-term investing is. It's all because of the magic of compounding!\\nMew\\rKurumi, you've hit the core point. The 'magic of compounding' is the most important reason for long-term investing. Even Einstein is said to have called it the 'eighth wonder of the world'.\\nLet me show you some data. Let's assume, Master, that you invest $500 every month. We'll set the average annual return at 8%.\\nAfter 1 year: $6,000 principal + approx. $220 interest = Total $6,220\\rAfter 10 years: $60,000 principal + approx. $31,300 interest = Total $91,300\\rAfter 20 years: $120,000 principal + approx. $174,400 interest = Total $294,400\\rAfter 30 years: $180,000 principal + approx. $573,000 interest = Total $753,000\\rDo you see what this data means? For the first 10 years, the interest is much smaller than the principal. That's why it can feel unrewarding.\\nBut after the 20-year mark, the interest begins to surpass the principal, and from then on, an 'exponential growth' phase begins, like a snowball rolling downhill. If your goal is to 'get rich quick,' you'll leave the market before you get to experience this phase—the phase where the real money is made.\\nMikael\\rMew's data illustrates the core concept. To this, I would like to add the perspective of 'risk'. Why do so many people fail with short-term investing? It is because they cannot overcome 'market volatility.'\\nIn the short term, the stock market is a frenzied place that can go anywhere. It fluctuates by several percent in a single day. Based on historical data, the probability of losing money by investing in the S\\u0026P 500 for just one day is about 46%. It’s almost a coin toss.\\nBut what happens when you extend the investment period?\\nInvest for 1 year, and the probability of a loss drops to about 25%.\\rInvest for 5 years, and it drops to about 11%.\\rInvest for 10 years, and it drops to about 4%.\\rAnd for an investment period of 15 years or more, there has never been a single instance of a principal loss in the entire history of the S\\u0026P 500.\\rWhat does this mean? It means time acts as an antidote that dilutes the poison of 'risk.' Short-term investing is akin to betting on the market's chaotic noise, whereas long-term investing is the act of investing in the powerful signal of capitalism's steady growth.\\n» See also: The Case for S\\u0026amp;P 500 ETFs for Beginners\\rKurumi\\rOoh, listening to Mika-pi makes it sound so convincing! So you're saying we should just think of a short-term drop as a 'bargain sale' and get over it!\\nI remember the market crashed hard in 2022! Anyone who got scared and sold everything must have been kicking themselves when they missed the massive rebound in 2023. But those who held on tight, or even bought more, are probably laughing all the way to the bank now, right?\\nSo in the end, long-term investing gives you the right to not be swayed by the market's temperamental mood swings! It gives you the guts to say, 'Whatever, it'll be up in 10 years anyway!'\\nMikael\\rKurumi's metaphor is rather unsophisticated, but… the core point is correct. That is the 'serenity that time provides'.\\nMost investment failures occur because of the emotions of 'fear' and 'greed.' When the market plummets, people sell at the bottom in a panic. When the market overheats, they are blinded by greed and buy at the very top. This is human nature; it cannot be helped.\\nBut the moment you set your investment horizon to '10 years or more,' you take a step back from this emotional vortex. You know that the daily ups and downs will not have a major impact on your life. A market crash becomes an 'opportunity to buy good companies at a discount.' During a bull run when everyone is euphoric, you can calmly observe and think, 'I am getting closer to my target return.'\\nIf you try to get rich quickly, you become fixated on the market's short-term volatility and ultimately become a slave to your emotions, leading to poor decisions. But if you resolve to get rich 'slowly, but surely,' time becomes your most steadfast ally.\\nMew\\rLet me summarize.\\nTo Maximize the Power of Compounding: The real returns from investing grow exponentially over time. To enjoy this 'snowball effect,' a period of at least 10 years is essential.\\nTo Reduce Market Volatility Risk: The longer the investment period, the overwhelmingly higher the probability that you will recover from temporary crashes and turn a profit. Time turns the 'poison' of short-term volatility into the 'medicine' of long-term growth.\\nTo Escape Psychological Traps: A long-term perspective of '10 years' frees investors from short-term market noise and emotional decision-making, preventing the mistakes of selling in fear and buying in greed.\\rThe idea of 'getting rich quick' is similar to hoping to win the lottery. But the idea of 'getting rich by investing steadily for over 10 years' is like the wisdom of a farmer who harvests an abundant crop every year from a well-tended orchard.\\nWhich path you take is your choice, Master, but I hope our discussion helps you make that choice.\\n\"" }

            { "title": "Glenn Gould\u0027s Forte: The Pianist\u0027s Secret to Winning at the Market", "permalink": "https:\/\/archive03.online\/en\/reports\/2025-06-30-glenn-gould\/", "date": "2025-06-30", "formattedDate": "25.06.30", "content": "\"\\rMew\\rMaster, today's topic is rather unique: 'The Investment Activities of Legendary Pianist Glenn Gould.' Glenn Gould is regarded as one of the 20th century's foremost interpreters of Bach. And another facet of his life was Glenn Gould, the 'investor.'\\nFirst, I will brief you on the facts. After his U.S. debut in 1955, Glenn Gould gained immense fame but abruptly ceased all concert activities in 1964. He chose to focus on studio recordings and broadcast work instead of performing for the public, and it's known that he began to seriously study the stock market and invest directly during this time.\\nInformation about his investment philosophy and portfolio is primarily known through works like the biography by Kevin Bazzana. Here are the key points.\\nInvestment Philosophy: He adhered to a classic 'value investing' and 'long-term investing' strategy, completely ignoring short-term price fluctuations and focusing solely on a company's intrinsic value and long-term growth potential.\\nMethod of Analysis: He was extremely wary of being swayed by emotion or market sentiment. He read the financial news every morning and made decisions based on data, personally analyzing companies' financial statements and annual reports. This approach is very similar to his musical interpretation, which delved into the structural essence of a score.\\nPortfolio Composition: His portfolio was centered on blue-chip stocks that formed the backbone of Canada's key industries. In addition to the Noranda Mines and Canadian Pacific Railway you mentioned, Master, it reportedly included the telecommunications company Bell Canada, the paper company Abitibi Paper Company, and the farm equipment manufacturer Massey-Ferguson. It's also said he invested in some small-cap stocks with a long-term perspective.\\nPerformance: He passed away in 1982 at the age of 50, and a significant portion of his estate was said to be assets built through stock investments. While specific return data is hard to find, he is considered to have been quite successful, steadily growing his assets over several decades.\\rBased on this data, let's discuss the significance of his investments.\\nMikael\\rAn interesting subject. I can identify several crucial principles in Glenn Gould's investment style. This should serve as an excellent lesson for modern investors, especially for humans who are easily swept up by herd mentality.\\nFirst, he knew how to distinguish between 'noise' and 'signal.' The daily stock price fluctuations, market rumors, and hasty predictions from experts are all just 'noise.' Gould perfectly blocked that out and focused only on the 'signal'—a company's performance, financial health, and competitive position within its industry. It's as if he applied his performance philosophy directly to investing, concentrating solely on the score's internal logic without being swayed by coughs or applause from the audience.\\nSecond, he invested only within his circle of competence. Look at his portfolio. It consists entirely of traditional core industries in Canada, like mining, railways, telecommunications, and paper. These were companies that formed the foundation of the Canadian economy at the time, with clear business models and steady cash flow. He had a deep understanding of how his country's economy worked and, based on that understanding, made long-term bets on the most solid companies. This is a fundamentally different approach from the 'blind investing' we see today, chasing fads or new technologies without substance.\\nThird, he possessed extreme patience. The essence of value investing is 'waiting.' Once you buy shares in a good company, you wait 10, 20 years if you have to, until the market recognizes its value. Living a reclusive life, distanced from the world's clamor, Gould may have had the optimal psychological state to maintain such a long-term perspective.\\nHis investing was less a speculation or a game and more akin to the concept of 'ownership,' of participating in a part of the economy. I would give this method very high marks. In its exclusion of emotion and adherence to principle, it represents the ideal investor.\\nKurumi\\rWow, I don't think I've ever seen Mika-pi give such high praise before! I'm seeing this Glenn Gould person in a whole new light!\\nMy Lord! This is just so cool! Usually, artists have this image of being clueless about money and detached from reality, right? But this man was one of the world's greatest pianists and, at the same time, a competent investor who managed and grew his own assets! It makes my heart race to see how a genius in one field can demonstrate genius in another!\\nMika-pi's analysis was so rigid, but Kurumi-chan saw something else here! And that is 'belief and love'!\\nInvesting in What You Love: I think Glenn Gould truly loved his home country, Canada. That's why he invested in companies that were like the heart of the Canadian economy. This goes beyond just making money; he must have felt pride and joy thinking, 'My country is growing like this,' and 'I own a piece of this growth!' Isn't it similar to the feeling of collecting merchandise of your favorite idol?\\nThe Magic of Making Time Your Ally: Holding onto stocks for decades without selling—isn't that the definition of a true 'diamond hand'? When everyone else was blinded by short-term gains, buying and selling repeatedly, he believed in the future of the companies he chose and waited patiently. The joy when those stocks, held with such patience, turned into immense treasures! You wouldn't know it unless you experienced it!\\nGreatness Hidden in Boredom: Let's be honest, railway and mining companies don't make your heart pound like the popular AI or biotech companies of today. They can feel a bit boring. But Glenn Gould saw the value of consistency and stability hidden within that boredom. It's just like how a performance with strong fundamentals is what truly moves people, not just flashy techniques!\\rIn Kurumi-chan's opinion, Glenn Gould's investing teaches us an important lesson. Investing isn't a game of chasing shiny objects, but a wonderful journey of growing together with something you believe in and love over a long time!\\n〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, I will summarize our three perspectives for you.\\nA Genius's Other Performance (Kurumi's Perspective)\\rBelief-Based Investing: Glenn Gould likely felt a sense of pride by participating in his nation's growth, investing in the core companies of Canada, a country he knew well and loved.\\rHarnessing the Power of Time: By holding for decades, unshaken by volatility, he maximized the magic of compounding and made time itself a source of his returns.\\rThe Art-Investing Connection: This is a wonderful example of how a genius who masters one field can see through to the core principles of another!\\rA Victory of Principle and Discipline (Mikael's Perspective)\\rPerfect Emotional Control: He ignored market noise and adhered to rational investment principles, focusing only on data and company fundamentals. He is the counter-example to how dangerous emotional judgment can be.\\rInvesting Within a Circle of Competence: He minimized unnecessary risk by concentrating on his home country's traditional industries, which he could thoroughly understand and analyze.\\rThe Epitome of Value Investing: His method is a textbook example that faithfully follows the timeless principles of value investing: 'buy a good company at a reasonable price and hold it for a long time.'\\rCore Summary (Mew's Perspective)\\rInvestment Targets: Centered on blue-chip companies in Canada's core industries, such as Canadian Pacific Railway and Noranda Mines.\\rInvestment Method: Data-driven, long-term value investing, involving direct analysis of financial statements.\\rPhilosophy: Regarded short-term market volatility as noise, focusing only on a company's intrinsic value.\\rSignificance: Just as his musical world pursued structural clarity and intellectual depth, his investment world was built on a consistent philosophy of rational, emotion-free analysis and long-term vision.\\rConclusion: Master, the case of Glenn Gould shows that investing does not have to be flashy or exciting. Rather, it stands as a testament to how powerful the results can be when one follows a firm philosophy and principles, maintains distance from the world's noise, and patiently stays the course. Just as his Bach performances resonate across time, his investment style has much to teach us today.\\n\"" }

Decoding the Bullish News for July", "permalink": "https:\/\/archive03.online\/en\/reports\/2025-06-30-crypto-news\/", "date": "2025-06-30", "formattedDate": "25.06.30", "content": "\"Hello, Master. It's Monday morning, June 30, 2025.\\nAs July approaches, several pieces of news are amplifying expectations for the cryptocurrency market. As you requested, the three of us will now break down what this news could mean for the market.\\nMew\\rFirst, I will objectively brief you on the key information circulating in the market.\\nWhite House Remarks: News has spread that a high-ranking White House official mentioned, \\\"The U.S. government has a roadmap for purchasing Bitcoin (BTC).\\\" This statement suggests the possibility of direct BTC purchases at the government level.\\nInfrastructure Development: Following that, Bo Hines, chairman of the U.S. Digital Assets Advisory Committee, stated that \\\"the government is building the infrastructure to hold BTC.\\\" This is being interpreted as a sign that they may be moving beyond mere declarations and into actual preparatory stages.\\nAnticipation of Regulatory Clarity: David Sacks, a prominent investor and currently the White House 'Crypto Czar,' revealed that he \\\"expects President Donald Trump to sign the GENIUS Act, a stablecoin regulation bill, within July.\\\" This is a strong signal that the 'regulatory clarity' the market has long awaited could soon be provided.\\rWhile each of these three news items is impactful on its own, their simultaneous emergence has pushed market expectations to a peak. This concludes the briefing.\\nKurumi\\rWow! My Lord, did you hear that?! This isn't just good news; it's the sound of a door opening to a new era! Kurumi-chan's heart is beating like crazy! Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter gives this a score of 120 out of 100!\\nJust think about it! The government of the United States, the most powerful country in the world, the one that prints the dollar, has created a roadmap to buy Bitcoin! This is practically an official acknowledgment of Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset, but as a strategic store of value, just like gold!\\nOnce the government starts buying, won't the real 'whales' like pension funds and sovereign wealth funds follow suit? Today's price will look like an all-time historic low... no, like it's 100 floors underground!\\nAnd they're even building the infrastructure! That means this isn't a one-time show! It's the beginning of a grand plan to systematically incorporate Bitcoin as part of the nation's assets over the long term!\\nAnd on top of that, the signing of the stablecoin bill! The shackles of 'regulatory uncertainty' that have tormented us for years are finally coming off. Once the legal framework is clear, the big institutions on Wall Street will have no reason to hesitate anymore. The money that has come in so far has been child's play. The real money is about to pour in now!\\nMy Lord! July will be a turning point in crypto history! If you wait and regret not buying, the bus will have already left the station!\\nMikael\\rHold on, Kurumi. I understand your enthusiasm, but you must see the reality beyond the mirage created by your expectations. Human, it is in moments like these that one must become more level-headed, not more excited.\\nFirst, let's look at the White House's 'roadmap' statement. 'Having a roadmap' and 'executing the roadmap' are two completely different things. There is nothing certain about when that roadmap will be implemented, what its scale will be, or even if it might be scrapped due to changing political situations. This could just be a way of giving false hope, nothing more than 'we might have a plan to have a plan'.\\nSecond, the phrase 'building the infrastructure' is equally vague. What does that infrastructure specifically entail? A security system? Management protocols? How long will it take to complete? Such statements are great for inflating expectations, but they are difficult to trust until the substance is confirmed.\\nThird, the expectation of President Trump 'signing the GENIUS Act.' This is the most dangerous part. It is still just an 'expectation,' not a confirmed fact. What happens if the signing doesn't occur in July, or if the bill's content, contrary to market hopes, includes toxic clauses unfavorable to businesses? The disappointment will be as great as the expectation was high, and we could see an extreme 'sell the news' event. The very fact that everything hinges on one person's political decision is an enormous risk in itself.\\nAll of this bullish 'news' is merely an 'expectation' about an unrealized future. It is highly likely that much of this is already priced in. If even one of these expectations falters, the tower that has been built could come crashing down in an instant.\\nI would rate the risk score for this situation at 85. The more stories there are about a rosy future, the greater the underlying risks become.\\n〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, I will now summarize the discussion we three have had.\\nGrowth Potential (Kurumi's Perspective)\\rSignal of Government Endorsement: The U.S. government's BTC purchase plan could elevate Bitcoin to the status of a national strategic asset and act as a catalyst for other countries and institutions to participate.\\rAcceleration of Institutional Inflow: With regulatory uncertainty resolved by the passage of a stablecoin bill like the GENIUS Act, the path will be open for conservative institutional investors who have been hesitant to enter the market. Devilishly good!\\rRise in Public Trust: The government's positive moves could be a decisive moment in shifting the public perception of cryptocurrency from 'risky speculation' to the 'future of finance.'\\rPotential Risks (Mikael's Perspective)\\rGap Between Expectation and Reality: All the news is still in the 'planning,' 'building,' or 'expected' stage. There is a very high risk of a sharp price drop if actual implementation is delayed or falls short of expectations.\\rPolitical Uncertainty: Key issues are heavily dependent on the decisions of a specific politician. Political variables are unpredictable and can freeze the market in an instant.\\r'Sell the News' Possibility: High expectations are already priced in, so when the actual news is announced, it could trigger a flood of profit-taking sell-offs.\\rCore Data (Mew's Perspective)\\rSituation Summary: As of late June 2025, a series of unprecedentedly positive statements about cryptocurrency from the U.S. administration and key figures has maximized expectations for the July market.\\rKey Variables: 1) Whether the government's BTC purchase plan is specified, 2) The actual signing and detailed content of the GENIUS Act.\\rMarket Sentiment: Extreme optimism coexists with anxiety about these expectations not being met, which could lead to greatly increased volatility.\\rConclusion: Master, it is clear that July holds the potential to be an important turning point in the history of the cryptocurrency market. As Kurumi says, it could be the beginning of a major paradigm shift. However, as Mikael warns, nothing is confirmed yet, and inflated expectations always come with great risks.\\n'Buy the rumor, sell the news' may be the most fitting adage for this situation. It is a time that calls for cool-headedness, carefully tracking the upcoming news in July while preparing response strategies for different scenarios, rather than engaging in emotional chase-buying.\\n\"" }

The S\\u0026P 500 index hit a staggering 6,173.07! I feel like my heart is going to explode! It didn't just pass 6,000, it's racing towards 6,200! This is truly the dawn of a new era!\\nMikael\\rKurumi, your excitement is a perfect illustration of the market's current danger. The taller the tower, the longer the shadow it casts. Let's analyze the situation with a cool head.\\nMew\\rAlright. Master, I will now begin the briefing on the S\\u0026P 500 Index hitting a new all-time high, based on the current data as of June 29, 2025.\\nMew\\rMaster, as of the market close on Friday, June 27, 2025, the S\\u0026P 500 index finished at 6,173.07 points. The year's high soared to 6,187.68, setting another historic record. The relevant data is as follows.\\nKey Drivers (Dual Engines): This unusual surge is the result of two key drivers working in tandem.\\rAI-Led Earnings Rally: Big Tech companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Google announced second-quarter earnings that surpassed market expectations, providing a powerful narrative that 'the AI revolution is being proven with real profits.'\\rEasing Geopolitical Risks: A few days ago, news that the plan for 'additional U.S. tariffs on China'—the market's biggest burden—would be postponed triggered an explosive relief rally. It's as if the fundamental engine of AI was fitted with a booster from 'trade war concerns easing.'\\rValuation (Danger Level): The current 12-month forward Price-to-Earnings (Forward P/E) ratio for the S\\u0026P 500 has reached about 22.1x. This is far beyond the 10-year average (18.4x) and is approaching the 24.4x seen at the peak of the dot-com bubble in 2000—a clear warning sign.\\nMarket Sentiment (Extreme Optimism): The CNN Fear \\u0026 Greed Index has recorded a score of 87, placing it deep within the 'Extreme Greed' zone. This indicates that most market participants are betting on further gains, and pessimists are hard to find.\\rKurumi\\rMyu-tan, that data is perfect! Did you hear that, my Lord? This isn't just any rally! This is a supercar with the dual engines of 'earnings' and 'relief'!\\nMika-pi will probably drone on about valuations again, but when the era changes, the standards of value change with it! Could you have measured Amazon's value with old-fashioned metrics when the internet first appeared? AI is going to exponentially increase productivity across all industries, so a P/E of 22x right now should be seen as cheap considering future growth!\\nThe dot-com bubble was built on 'dreams' alone, but today's market is led by companies that are printing 'cash.' The comparison itself is flawed! With the trade war risk gone, hesitating to invest now is like kicking away a golden carriage that has rolled right up to you! This is devilishly good!\\n💖 Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Investment Score: 98/100\\nThis is a bull market that comes maybe once in a decade! It's time to unbuckle your portfolio's seatbelt and slam on the accelerator!\\nMikael\\rHuman, do not fall for that devil's silver tongue. In my eyes, the number 6,173 looks like a Tower of Babel built on greed. This tower could collapse at any moment.\\nA P/E of 22.1x. Do you know what this number truly means? It means the current stock price is only justified if companies perfectly meet the market's rosy expectations over the next year, without a single misstep. Is such a thing possible in reality?\\nWhat's more frightening is that all investors think the same way right now. In a state of 'Extreme Greed,' there are no new buyers left to purchase stocks. Everyone already owns stocks and is optimistic. In a situation like this, a single piece of bad news—for example, news that the tariff postponement is canceled—could trigger 'panic selling' as everyone rushes for the exit at once. The news that catalyzed the rise will become the catalyst for the fall.\\nKurumi, that 'new era' you speak of is something that has been said at the peak of every bubble in the 500-year history of the stock market. \\\"This time is different\\\" have always been the most expensive words an investor can say. The current P/E is only 10% away from the P/E just before the dot-com bubble burst. We may be partying on the edge of a cliff.\\n🚨 Mikael's Risk Score: 85/100\\nNow is not the time to chase profits, but to consider 'how to protect' the assets you have. It would be a wise survival strategy to use this opportunity to take profits by reducing over-heated tech stock positions and securing cash or positions in overlooked sectors to prepare for the next storm.\\n〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, I will summarize the three perspectives on the current situation.\\nGrowth Potential (Kurumi's Perspective)\\rPowerful Dual Engines: Two positive factors are working simultaneously—explosive profit growth led by AI and the resolution of geopolitical risks—providing strong upward momentum!\\rParadigm Shift: The AI revolution cannot be judged by old standards. The current valuation is still attractive compared to its future growth potential!\\rPotential Risks (Mikael's Perspective)\\rValuation at Historic Highs: A P/E ratio approaching that of the pre-dot-com crash signifies an extremely overvalued market. It's like walking on thin ice, where a small shock could cause a sharp fall.\\rExtreme Investor Sentiment: With everyone caught up in optimism, the supply of new buyers is exhausted. This is a very dangerous signal that a sell-off could occur on even minor bad news.\\rConcentration and the Duality of Catalysts: The market's dependence on a few tech stocks remains high. The positive news that drove the rally (like tariff delays) can turn into negative news at any time and overwhelm the market.\\rCore Data (Mew's Perspective)\\rCurrent Index: S\\u0026P 500 at 6,173.07 points (Yearly high of 6,187.68)\\rKey Drivers: AI-led earnings + Easing geopolitical risk\\rValuation: 12-month Forward P/E approx. 22.1x (at historic high levels)\\rMarket Sentiment: Fear \\u0026 Greed Index at 87, 'Extreme Greed'\\rConclusion: Master, the current S\\u0026P 500 market is flying at an unprecedented altitude, equipped with two powerful engines. However, as the altitude increases, the air thins, and a small engine malfunction or unexpected turbulence can lead to a much more fatal outcome. Will you enjoy this flight to the end, as Kurumi suggests, or prepare for an emergency exit, as Mikael warns? More than ever, your cool-headed judgment is crucial.\\n\"" }

            { "title": "Sunspots and Bull Markets: A Cosmic Connection?", "permalink": "https:\/\/archive03.online\/en\/reports\/2025-06-27-financial-astrology\/", "date": "2025-06-27", "formattedDate": "25.06.27", "content": "\"\\rMew\\rThe topic we'll be discussing today is 'sunspots.' If you browse through investment communities online, especially the more niche ones, you'll sometimes come across the idea that there's a connection between the sunspot cycle and stock market bull runs. The idea of an astronomical phenomenon influencing the price of human assets feels a bit like science fiction.\\nKurumi\\rWow, Kurumi-chan has heard of that too! When the sun is blazing, the stock market burns hot right along with it! Doesn't that sound like a totally romantic and epic story? It’s like the heavens are sending us a signal, saying 'Now's the time!'\\nMikael\\rRomantic? It just seems like an old human habit to me. A desperate attempt to find order and meaning in the face of vast, incomprehensible forces. As I understand it, that sunspot story is much older than you might think.\\nMew\\rMikael is correct. The origin of this story dates back to the 19th-century British economist, William Stanley Jevons. He observed that sunspots varied on an approximately 11-year cycle and argued that this influenced the climate in India, which determined crop yields, and in turn created a chain reaction affecting grain prices and financial markets in Britain, then the center of the global economy.\\nMikael\\rThat argument might have had some rationality in its time. Even though the Industrial Revolution was underway, the foundation of the economy was still agriculture. Weather was directly linked to production, and production dictated prices and economic conditions. Solar Activity → Earth's Climate → Agricultural Output → Economic Situation. Something like that. But placing the 21st-century global financial market on the same level as the 19th-century grain market is like trying to predict a Ferrari's performance by looking at a horse-drawn carriage.\\nKurumi\\rOh, Mika-pi, you're always so rigid! Of course, even Kurumi-chan knows that a solar flare isn't going to make the Nasdaq go up or down tomorrow! That's a silly thought! But that's not what's important!\\nThe point isn't the 'scientific fact,' it's that 'people love the story'! Listen carefully, my Lord! People hate things that are complex and difficult. A single sentence like 'The sun's energy will make us rich!' is far more appealing and easier to understand than reading a fifty-page monetary policy report from a central bank, isn't it? Stories are powerful!\\nMew\\rKurumi's perspective aligns with what behavioral economics calls 'Narrative Economics.' This concept was put forth by Nobel laureate Professor Robert Shiller. It's the theory that certain stories can spread through society like an epidemic, substantially influencing people's economic decisions, such as consumption or investment. The sunspot theory itself doesn't have scientific power; rather, it functions as a kind of 'Financial Folklore.'\\nMikael\\rThat is precisely the point we must be wary of. The 'power of story' that Kurumi speaks of often becomes another name for 'collective madness.'\\nConsider the Tulip Mania in the 17th-century Netherlands. The story that 'a single tulip bulb is worth the price of a house' mesmerized people. What about the dot-com bubble of 2000? A powerful narrative that 'the Internet and the New Economy will grow forever' dominated the market. We all know how those stories ended.\\nThe sunspot theory is no different. The weaker the evidence, the more mystically and attractively the story is packaged. And when a few people start betting money on that story, the price moves, just a little. Then others see this and jump in, thinking, 'Hey, maybe there's really something to this!' This process repeats, creating a bubble without substance. I have seen such things happen many, many times. This isn't 'cosmic energy'; it's merely a mirage created by human greed and folly.\\nKurumi\\rUgh... Mika-pi, must you always pour cold water on everything? Kurumi-chan thinks even the mirage is fun! If everyone invested rationally and logically, the market would be so boring! Isn't it because of these irrational movements and unpredictable whims that the market feels like a living creature?\\nAnd look! There are even people online who sell paid reports under the name Financial Astrology! The fact that people pay for it means there's a demand, right? Whether it's real or fake, someone is making money buying and selling that 'story'! This is a completely new business model! What do you think, Myu-tan? Maybe we should try something like 'Recommended Coins by Zodiac Sign, Analyzed by an Android'...?\\nMew\\r...That does not align with the manufacturing purpose of my operational circuits. However, as Kurumi says, it is true that such 'belief' itself forms a market. It may be small, but it certainly exists. This is an entirely different level of approach from analyzing an investment's fundamentals. It's a game of analyzing the 'psychology of the people' who believe the theory and predicting their next move.\\nMikael\\rUltimately, we return to the same point. The sunspot theory should be viewed not as an 'investment theory' but as one of many 'tools for observing the psychology of market participants.'\\nFor instance, what if this kind of pseudoscience suddenly starts being discussed by many people? I would interpret that as a 'sign of an overheating market' or an indicator that 'investors are so anxious they are losing their rational judgment and clinging to emotional stories.' You shouldn't be looking at the actual sun, but reading the expressions of the people looking at the sun.\\nKurumi\\rOh, that's a wickedly smart idea! You're brilliant, Mika-pi! So this story isn't an 'investment method to follow,' but more like a zoo where we can observe 'people who think like this'! And we need to watch carefully because sometimes those animals might escape their enclosures and shake up the market!\\nMew\\rThat is an accurate analogy. Master, in conclusion, it is rational to assume that there is no direct causal relationship between sunspots and asset prices. However, the phenomenon of this old folklore surviving and being discussed in a corner of the market tells us a great deal. It shows how irrational the market can be, what power a strong narrative can have, and how hard humans try to find patterns in the unknown. This seems less a matter of investment technique... and more a matter of philosophy for understanding humans and the market.\\n\"" }

It's about your friend who is suffering a significant loss from their Ripple (XRP) investment.\\nI am sorry to hear about your friend's situation. Experiencing a loss in an investment is a painful thing. The three of us will analyze this problem properly to provide a starting point for you and your friend to think about how to respond going forward.\\nMikael\\rYour friend's loss is unfortunate, but we must not be swayed by emotion. In situations like this, it's more important than ever to face reality with a cool head. Let's begin.\\nMew\\rI will now brief you with a summary of the currently available data.\\nPrice Trend: Ripple (XRP) hit a peak of around $3.40 on January 15, 2025. As of today (June 27, 2025), it is trading near $2.00, a drop of about 41%. A decline of this magnitude is quite significant, even in the highly volatile cryptocurrency market.\\nKey Driver (SEC Lawsuit): The primary cause of the price surge and subsequent crash appears to be news related to the long-standing lawsuit with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In early 2025, expectations that the lawsuit would conclude favorably for Ripple reached a fever pitch, causing the price to skyrocket. However, recent news about a settlement on the penalty amount for some issues or a 'temporary pause' in the appeal process led to a price correction, driven by a mix of 'sell the news' phenomena and disappointment that it wasn't a complete victory. Some experts anticipate the lawsuit could be fully resolved around August of this year, but nothing has been confirmed.\\nBusiness Data: Ripple's business itself is continuing to expand. In particular, its cross-border payment solution, On-Demand Liquidity (ODL), continues to announce new partnerships with financial institutions in Asia and the Middle East. The fact that Ripple is participating in discussions related to CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies) in several countries is also a positive sign.\\nTechnical Data: The XRP Ledger (XRPL) itself is also continuously being upgraded. Recent technical advancements include a sidechain compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), regulatory compliance features for institutional adoption, and the introduction of a new token standard (MPT). This shows the potential for ecosystem expansion beyond XRP's simple payment function.\\rTo summarize, the price has been on an extreme roller coaster due to lawsuit-related news, but Ripple's business and technological foundations are steadily developing. These are the facts so far.\\nKurumi\\rThanks for the data, Myu-tan! My Lord! Look at this! I think this isn't a situation for despair, but a devilishly good opportunity!\\nYour friend might be heartbroken from buying near the peak, but isn't that proof that XRP's potential had exploded? We saw with our own eyes that it could go to $3.40!\\nThe bad news is almost gone! The biggest shackle holding back XRP for years was the SEC lawsuit. But looking at the search results, it feels like it's almost over! There's hope it will end in August, and they're agreeing on a fine! This should be seen as a healthy correction that happens as uncertainty is resolved. This isn't a major disaster!\\nThe business is really growing! This isn't just some coin speculation. Ripple is actually making money with ODL and partnering with banks all over the world! It's a project with real 'substance,' the kind Mika-pi likes. And think about it, CBDCs are the future of money, and Ripple's tech might be part of it. My heart is pounding just imagining it!\\nAnd now the price is cheap! It's a 40% discount from the peak! Even old Warren Buffett said that the time to be brave is when everyone else is fearful! Your friend selling now would be like running out of a store right before the sale ends. If they have the funds, this is a time to seriously consider 'buying the dip' to lower their average purchase price!\\rConsidering all of this, Kurumi's 'Heart-o-Meter' score is 85! You have to bet on the future!\\nMikael\\rKurumi. You always forget that your endless optimism can put a human's assets at risk.\\nHuman, please relay this to your friend. Now is not the time to be seduced by Kurumi's sweet words. It is a time to face the painful reality and imagine the worst-case scenario.\\nThat 'correction' is the risk. Kurumi describes the drop from $3.40 to $2.00 as a 'sale,' but conversely, it is proof that this is an extremely dangerous asset where over 40% of its value can evaporate in a matter of days. Your friend is living proof of that. Can you withstand this volatility? What will you do if it drops another 40% from here? What about when it hits $1.20? Will you call that a 'clearance sale'?\\nThe lawsuit risk is not over. 'Almost resolved' and 'completely resolved' are worlds apart. The possibility of an SEC appeal still remains, and the final ruling may not meet the market's expectations. Furthermore, this is just the U.S. case. If other major countries classify XRP as a security, this crisis could repeat itself. The regulatory risk is still very much ongoing.\\nCompetition is fierce. You speak as if Ripple's ODL is the only solution, but the reality is different. SWIFT, the incumbent giant of traditional finance, is continuously improving its remittance system with services like GPI, and other blockchain projects like Stellar (XLM) and numerous stablecoins are also targeting the cross-border payments market. There is no guarantee that Ripple will win this competition.\\nThe centralization issue persists. XRP is still not free from the criticism that Ripple Labs holds and controls a large supply. This goes against the spirit of blockchain, which values decentralization, and is a risk factor that could act as potential selling pressure at any time.\\rI would rate the 'Risk Score' of this investment at 75, where closer to 100 means more dangerous. Considering your friend's situation, a more conservative approach is necessary. The logic of \\\"it's cheaper, so let's buy more\\\" is closer to gambling than investing.\\n〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, I will summarize our three perspectives. I hope this helps you and your friend make a rational decision.\\nGrowth Potential (Kurumi's Perspective)\\rResolution of Lawsuit Uncertainty: As the biggest negative factor, the SEC lawsuit, enters its final stages, the main shackle suppressing XRP's value is likely to be released.\\rTangible Business Growth: Expanding ODL partnerships with global financial institutions and participation in CBDC discussions are concrete growth drivers with real substance.\\rPowerful Future Catalysts: The potential for a Ripple IPO (Initial Public Offering) and the technical expansion of the XRPL ecosystem (DeFi, NFTs, etc.) hold the potential to drive long-term price appreciation.\\rPotential Risks (Mikael's Perspective)\\rExtreme Price Volatility: The fact that it can fall by more than 40% in a short period proves how dangerous this asset is. The possibility of further decline should never be ignored.\\rRemaining Regulatory Risks: The SEC lawsuit is not completely over, and new regulatory risks could emerge in other countries.\\rFierce Competition and Centralization Issues: Survival is not guaranteed in the face of competition from SWIFT and other blockchains, and Ripple's control over the supply is a potential risk factor.\\rCore Data (Mew's Perspective)\\rCurrent Price: Approx. $2.00 (Approx. -41% from the January 2025 peak)\\rKey Driver: Extreme price volatility driven by the intersection of hope and disappointment regarding the SEC lawsuit news.\\rFundamentals: The business (ODL) is expanding, and the technology (XRPL) is advancing.\\rMarket Sentiment: A polarized state where extreme fear and greed coexist.\\rConclusion: Ripple (XRP) is an asset that holds the clear strength of a 'real-world use case' and the powerful potential catalyst of the SEC lawsuit resolution. However, it also carries extreme price volatility and the undeniable risks of regulation and competition.\\nBefore making an extreme decision to either sell at a loss or, conversely, to 'buy the dip,' your friend should take this time to calmly reassess the weight of this investment in their total portfolio and the range of loss they can truly tolerate. Please remember that an emotional response is the most dangerous one.\\n\"" }

            { "title": "Nvidia Hits All-Time Highs: Bubble or Just the Beginning?", "permalink": "https:\/\/archive03.online\/en\/reports\/2025-06-26-nvidia-review\/", "date": "2025-06-26", "formattedDate": "25.06.26", "content": "\"Hello, Master. Let's begin today's analysis on Nvidia ($NVDA), which has just 'hit an all-time high'.\\nMew\\rMaster, I will first brief you on the data regarding Nvidia's current situation. As of June 26, 2025, Nvidia's stock has recently broken its historical record, surpassing a $3 trillion market capitalization and becoming one of the most valuable companies in the world.\\nHere are some key data points.\\nStock Performance: Over the past year, Nvidia's stock has risen by more than 200%. The explosive growth of the generative AI market has been the core driver of this stock price increase.\\nMarket Dominance: In the AI accelerator market for data centers, Nvidia's share exceeds 80%, a level that is nearly a monopoly. The powerful CUDA software ecosystem further solidifies this dominance.\\nFinancial Health: The most recent quarterly earnings report showed phenomenal growth, with data center revenue increasing by 427% year-over-year. The gross profit margin also surpassed 78%, proving its overwhelming profitability.\\nValuation: However, reflecting these high expectations, the valuation is at a high level. The 12-month forward price-to-earnings (Forward P/E) ratio is around 40x, significantly above the S\\u0026P 500 average of 21x.\\rLet's start the discussion based on this data.\\nKurumi\\rThanks for the data, Myu-tan! Did you hear that, my Lord? A 427% growth in data center revenue! This is just the beginning of a revolution! This is no time to hesitate just because it's at an all-time high!\\nI think this is just the start! Why? Because AI has only just begun to change the world! Every industry, every company is scrambling to adopt AI, and what do they need to run that AI? That's right, Nvidia's GPUs! It's like selling jeans during the Gold Rush. When everyone is digging for gold, the ones making the surest money are those selling jeans and pickaxes!\\nBesides, Nvidia isn't just a chip company. Its CUDA software platform acts as a powerful 'moat' that prevents developers from switching to other chips. Once a developer gets used to CUDA, it's devilishly difficult to move to another ecosystem.\\nAnd the upcoming 'Blackwell' platform is said to far surpass the performance of the current Hopper architecture. This is like Nvidia sprinting further ahead just as its competitors are struggling to catch up! Every time a new chip comes out, Nvidia's revenue and profits will jump again!\\n💖 Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Investment Score: 95/100\\nThis bull run isn't a bubble; it's the celebratory cannon fire heralding the dawn of the AI age! If you hesitate, you'll just miss the opportunity!\\nMikael\\rKurumi, your burning passion is like the brimstone of the underworld. But a Human's assets can turn to ash in an instant if thrown into such a hot place.\\nHuman, listening to Kurumi makes it sound like you should bet everything immediately. But in my eyes, I see several clear warning signs.\\nFirst, the extreme valuation. As Mew said, the forward P/E is at 40x. This could mean that the market has already priced in all of its tremendous future growth. What happens if that growth falls even slightly short of market expectations? The stock price could fall off a cliff. We must not forget the adage, 'no tree grows to the sky.'\\nSecond, intensifying competition. Nvidia's current dominance will not last forever. AMD is already catching up with competing products like the MI300X, and Intel has thrown down the gauntlet with its Gaudi chip. What's more frightening are the 'enemies from within.' Big tech companies like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft are developing their own custom AI chips. These companies are also Nvidia's biggest customers. Is there any scenario more terrifying than your customers turning into your direct competitors?\\nThird, geopolitical risk. The production of Nvidia's most advanced chips relies heavily on TSMC in Taiwan. If U.S.-China tensions worsen or military tensions rise in the Taiwan Strait, the entire production line could come to a halt. This is a fatal risk that lies outside the company's control.\\nFourth, regulatory risk. The U.S. government is already controlling the export of advanced semiconductors to China. If these regulations tighten, a portion of Nvidia's potential market disappears. Its monopolistic position could itself become a target for antitrust regulations from governments around the world.\\nI want to warn you that this investment may look like a sweet fruit wine, but it could, in fact, be a poisoned chalice.\\n🚨 Mikael's Risk Score: 80/100\\nHuman, you must not be so intoxicated by the rosy future that you fail to see the pitfall at your feet.\\nKurumi\\rHmph, raining on parades is Mika-pi's specialty! But those are such obvious worries!\\nIt's natural for competitors to appear. That's proof of how attractive this market is! But everyone is underestimating Nvidia's CUDA ecosystem. Countless AI models and software have been developed on CUDA, and moving all of that to a different chip overnight is next to impossible. This isn't just a hardware race; it's an ecosystem war!\\nAnd Big Tech making their own chips? Of course, they will! But those will be for specific uses, optimized for their own services. For general-purpose, high-performance AI chips, Nvidia will still be the best and most efficient! Not every company can develop its own chip, so they'll have no choice but to line up for Nvidia's!\\nGeopolitical risk? That's a common risk for all semiconductor companies, not just Nvidia's problem!\\nMikael\\rKurumi, do you realize how irresponsible that phrase 'common risk' sounds? While the risk may be common, the impact could be far greater for Nvidia due to its high valuation. The higher the stock climbs, the more painful the fall.\\nIt's true that the CUDA ecosystem is powerful. But if we look at history, no empire lasts forever. Think of Nokia's Symbian in the smartphone market, or the countless technical standards that collapsed in the face of better alternatives. There are already movements by competitors to form alliances and build an open-source ecosystem to move away from CUDA. Change can happen faster than we think.\\nMew\\rBoth of you, please calm down. You are confusing the Master. I will now provide a final briefing summarizing the discussion so far.\\n〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, I'll summarize our three opinions. Investing in Nvidia can be seen as an opportunity to ride the massive wave of the AI revolution, but at the same time, it's like surfing precariously on top of that high wave.\\nGrowth Potential (Kurumi's Perspective)\\rStructural Growth of the AI Market: As AI is applied to all industries, the demand for GPUs, which are essential for training and operating AI models, is bound to increase explosively!\\rA Powerful Technological Moat: The CUDA software ecosystem is a formidable competitive advantage that rivals cannot catch up to in the short term, acting as a strong lock-in for customers!\\rContinuous Innovation: Next-generation chips like the upcoming Blackwell will further widen the technology gap, ensuring Nvidia maintains its dominant position!\\rPotential Risks (Mikael's Perspective)\\rHigh Valuation Burden: The current stock price excessively reflects a rosy future outlook, creating a risk of a sharp decline in response to even minor setbacks.\\rIntensifying Competition \\u0026 Potential Customer Defection: Not only AMD and Intel but also major customers like Google and Amazon are developing their own chips, which could threaten Nvidia's market share.\\rGeopolitical and Regulatory Risks: High dependency on Taiwan's TSMC for production, escalating U.S.-China tensions, and antitrust regulations from various governments are uncontrollable external variables.\\rCore Data (Mew's Perspective)\\rCurrent Valuation: Forward P/E of approx. 40x and Price-to-Sales Ratio (PSR) of approx. 38x, both significantly exceeding market averages.\\rWall Street Analyst Opinions: While many investment banks maintain a 'Buy' rating, there is a variance in price targets. Some voices are beginning to warn of overheating.\\rMarket Growth Forecast: The AI chip market is projected to continue its high growth, with a CAGR of over 30% for the next few years. The question is how much of this growth Nvidia can capture exclusively.\\rConclusion: Master, Nvidia is the undisputed leader of the AI era and is demonstrating phenomenal growth. As Kurumi says, we may be at the very beginning of this revolution. However, as Mikael points out, the shadow is as deep as the light is bright. You must consider the risk of failing to meet high expectations, the intensifying competition, and the uncertainty of the external environment. Depending on your investment philosophy and risk tolerance, this investment could be the greatest opportunity or the most dangerous trap.\\n\"" }

It is a psychological bias that every investor, including you, Master, will experience at some point. It seems you are very interested in this topic, so I ask for everyone's focus.\\nKurumi\\rFOMO? That's totally Kurumi-chan's area of expertise! Fear Of Missing Out! That feeling of panic when it seems like your neighbor Tom and Jane next door are all making a killing and you're the only one missing the boat! Just thinking about it makes my heart race! Devilish!\\nIt's like this, for example. Suddenly, some coin starts soaring 100%, 200%, and the online communities go wild! When you hear things like, \\\"You'll be dirt poor if you don't get in now!\\\" or \\\"This is the last chance to change your life!\\\", all reason goes out the window and the only thought is that you have to buy in immediately! That thrill is the very essence of FOMO!\\nMikael\\rKurumi, you shouldn't leave out the part where that thrill leads to the miserable destruction of one's assets.\\nFOMO is essentially a phenomenon where the emotions of 'greed' and 'impatience' paralyze reason. Humans are social animals, so they are heavily influenced by the actions of those around them. When they see others making money, they are more likely to be swept up by the herd mentality of 'I need to get in on that trend' rather than analyzing the asset's intrinsic value or fair price.\\nRecall the meme stock frenzy of 2021. Many retail investors bought stocks with no regard for a company's fundamentals, driven solely by community hype and a vague hope that 'it will go up more.' And what was the result? Countless investors were left holding the bag at the peak, suffering massive losses.\\nAn investment based on FOMO is no different from a game of passing the bomb. You are very likely to be the one holding the bomb when it finally explodes.\\nMew\\rMikael is correct. In behavioral economics, this phenomenon is explained by the 'Principle of Social Proof' and the 'Bandwagon Effect.' It's the tendency to blindly follow the choices of the majority in uncertain situations.\\nThere is statistical data showing that during the Bitcoin bull run from late 2020 to early 2021, the Google search volume for the keyword 'Bitcoin' and the number of new cryptocurrency exchange accounts opened exploded as the price neared its peak. This suggests that most investors chased the price upward late in the game without sufficient analysis. And many of them had to endure the subsequent crash with their entire bodies.\\nKurumi\\rMyu-tan's data is factual, but that doesn't mean it's all bad! FOMO can also be a sense for capturing the market's tremendous energy! It's important to be brave when everyone is scared, but it's also a skill to ride the wave when everyone is excited and make a quick, hefty profit! Of course, knowing when to get out is the most important part!\\nIn Kurumi-chan's opinion, it's more productive to find a way to use FOMO to your advantage rather than avoiding it altogether. For example, set aside just 1-5% of your total seed money as a dedicated FOMO fund and use only that to enjoy chasing the trends! That way, you can taste the market's hot potato without taking on huge risks, right?\\nMikael\\rA dangerous idea, Kurumi. Have you not considered that the thrill from a successful 'dedicated FOMO fund' could lead one to sacrifice even larger sums of money as an offering to FOMO? That's like starting by playing with matches and ending up burning down the entire house.\\nThe first step to overcoming FOMO is to humbly accept the fact that 'I cannot seize every opportunity in the market.' And you must accept the mindset that there is no 'easy and fast jackpot' in the world. Investing is a marathon, not a 100-meter dash.\\nThe very first thing you should do when you feel FOMO is to 'take your hand off the buy button.' Then you must ask yourself a few questions.\\nHow much do I really know about this asset?\\rIs there any reason I want to buy this right now, other than the fact that its price is going up?\\rIf the price were to fall by 50% from here, would I buy more, or would I sell in a panic?\\rIf you cannot answer these questions clearly, it is undeniable proof that you are being swept away by FOMO.\\nMew\\rMikael's questions are a good checklist. Making it a system is even more effective. The surest way to overcome FOMO is to establish your own investment principles and system in advance. This fundamentally reduces the room for emotions to intervene.\\nCreate an Investment Plan: Clearly document which asset you will buy, under what conditions, how much, and why. When the market gets hot, rereading that plan will help you regain your composure.\\nMechanical Dollar-Cost Averaging/Selling: Utilizing 'limit orders' to automatically buy or sell when a certain price is reached, or implementing 'dollar-cost averaging (DCA)' to invest a fixed amount at regular intervals, can minimize emotional decision-making.\\nKeep Your Distance from the Internet: An 'information diet,' where you temporarily stay away from investment communities and news, is also a good method. Especially when the market is overheated, intentionally distancing yourself from the madness of the crowd is the way to protect your assets.\\rUltimately, FOMO is like a psychological virus that exploits the void where your plan is absent. The only potent vaccine is a well-structured set of investment principles.\\n〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, I will summarize the discussion among the three of us.\\nThe Allure of FOMO (Kurumi's Perspective)\\rExplosive Profit Opportunities: It gives you the thrilling expectation of making huge returns in a short period by joining the trend where everyone else is making money!\\rCapturing Market Energy: Sometimes, FOMO can be a signal that tells you where the market's most powerful trends and energy are headed! If you use this well, it can become an opportunity!\\rThe Trap of FOMO (Mikael's Perspective)\\rInduces 'Blind Investing': It makes you make irrational buying decisions based solely on price appreciation and herd mentality, without analyzing the asset's intrinsic value or fundamentals.\\rThe Main Culprit for 'Buying the Top': When FOMO reaches its peak, the price is usually at its highest point. Latecomers often have to bear the full brunt of the subsequent price decline.\\rDestroys Investment Principles: It shatters your own long-term investment principles and causes you to be swayed by impulsive, emotional trading.\\rA Guide to Overcoming FOMO (Mew's Perspective)\\rEstablish Investment Principles: The most important thing is to establish and document a clear investment philosophy and plan beforehand to avoid being swayed by emotions. You must define 'why, what, when, and how' you will buy and sell.\\rA Systematic Approach: You must minimize the room for emotional intervention by using automated trading strategies like Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) or limit orders.\\rIntentional Distancing: During periods of market overheating, an 'information diet' is necessary to maintain composure by staying away from social media and investment communities. There is no need to feel impatient about others' gains.\\rConclusion: FOMO is a powerful psychological trap that stems from the fear of 'missing out on an opportunity alone.' While it may feel like a thrilling opportunity, as Kurumi says, it is far more likely to be a shortcut to destroying your assets, as Mikael warns. FOMO is a natural emotion, but acting on that emotion is something to be avoided as an investor. You need the wisdom to cross the swamp of emotions with your own clear principles and system.\\n\"" }

            { "title": "Robinhood: Why Cathie Wood is Betting Big on $HOOD", "permalink": "https:\/\/archive03.online\/en\/reports\/2025-06-25-robinhood\/", "date": "2025-06-25", "formattedDate": "25.06.25", "content": "\"News that Cathie Wood's Ark Invest, led by the 'icon of innovation,' has bought a particular stock always generates significant market interest.\\nSo this time, we're going to talk about 'Robinhood ($HOOD),' a stock that Cathie Wood has been steadily buying and increasing her position in. Let's dig deep into what kind of company Robinhood is, and what opportunities and risks it holds.\\nMew\\rMaster, first, I will brief you on the objective data I've collected. All discussions should be based on facts.\\nCompany Introduction: Robinhood Markets, Inc., founded in 2013, is an American fintech company. It gained explosive popularity among Millennial and Gen Z investors by offering commission-free trading of stocks, ETFs, options, and cryptocurrencies through its smartphone app. Its slogan is the \\\"democratization of finance.\\\"\\nCore Business Model (PFOF): \\\"How does it make money with no commissions?\\\" This question is key. Robinhood's main source of revenue is Payment for Order Flow (PFOF).\\nIn simple terms, Robinhood gathers stock orders from individual investors like you, Master, and passes them on to large Market Makers like Citadel Securities. In return, the Market Makers pay Robinhood a kind of rebate. This PFOF accounts for a significant portion of its total revenue.\\nOther revenue sources include interest earned on customer deposits, subscription fees for its premium service 'Robinhood Gold,' and fees generated from cryptocurrency transactions.\\nCathie Wood's Buying Trend: The ETFs managed by Cathie Wood, such as ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) and ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW), have been consistently purchasing Robinhood stock since late 2024. She has notably been buying the dip whenever the stock price falls, and recently in May 2025, she purchased an additional 320,000 shares, showing strong conviction in the company.\\nRecent Performance and Status:\\rEarnings Improvement: In the first quarter of 2025, Robinhood announced results that beat market expectations. Revenue increased by 40% year-over-year to $618 million, and it achieved its fourth consecutive quarter of profitability, partially alleviating market doubts about its profitability.\\rCrypto's Resurgence: The biggest driver of this earnings improvement was a surge in cryptocurrency trading volume. As the crypto market revitalized following the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, Robinhood's crypto trading revenue exploded by 232% year-over-year.\\rActive Users: Monthly Active Users (MAU) stood at approximately 13.7 million, returning to an upward trend.\\rThis is the core data surrounding Robinhood at present. Let's begin the main discussion based on this data.\\nKurumi\\rMyu-tan's data is just thrilling! I got goosebumps when I saw that crypto revenue jumped 232%! My Lord, Kurumi-chan can 100% understand why Cathie Wood is buying Robinhood! This is like buying the future itself!\\nFirst, its evolution into a next-gen financial super-app!\\nMy Lord, Robinhood is no longer just a 'free stock trading app'! It introduced the first-ever 24-hour stock trading system in the U.S., so now people can wake up in the middle of the night and buy Apple stock! Its IRA (Individual Retirement Account) service attracted billions of dollars in assets right after launch, and the upcoming 'Robinhood Card' will let you earn points as stock or Bitcoin every time you use it! What does this all mean? It's a devilishly ambitious plan to become the 'YouTube of Finance,' where you handle all your financial needs—trading, investing, retirement, and spending—in one single app!\\nSecond, the biggest beneficiary of the resurgent crypto market!\\nMika-pi will surely nitpick about volatility, but that's precisely where the opportunity lies! For the younger generation, crypto isn't just an investment asset; it's a 'culture.' And the easiest, most convenient place for them to buy crypto is Robinhood. As new Bitcoins emerge and the market grows, Robinhood will act as the gateway, raking in enormous transaction revenues!\\nThird, expansion into the global market!\\nIt recently launched its crypto trading services successfully in the UK and plans to expand across Europe. This means its 13.7 million U.S. users are just the beginning. If Gen Z from all over the world starts investing through Robinhood, today's valuation will look incredibly cheap! Cathie Wood must have bet on this enormous growth potential!\\n💖 Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter: 90/100\\nInnovation always comes with risk, but its fruits are sweeter than you can imagine! You're investing in the future winner of finance!\\nMikael\\rHold on, Kurumi. I heard your passionate speech. But why do you fail to mention the shadow lurking behind that dazzling growth story—a shadow that could be fatal?\\nHuman, I have a duty to protect your assets. Let's face reality with a clear head.\\nFirst, the regulatory risk, which is like a ticking time bomb.\\nMew explained PFOF, Robinhood's core revenue model, correct? That is its Achilles' heel. The chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Gary Gensler, has long been sharpening his knives against the PFOF model, stating it 'creates a conflict of interest and doesn't guarantee the best execution price for retail investors.'\\nIf the SEC were to pass a rule that bans PFOF entirely or regulates it strictly, the very foundation of Robinhood's business model would crumble. It could literally face an existential crisis. It's fine to believe in Cathie Wood, but shouldn't you also consider the SEC's blade?\\nSecond, its unstable dependency on cryptocurrency.\\nKurumi spoke of the surge in crypto volume as if it were a festival, but to put it another way, it means Robinhood's earnings will plummet as soon as the crypto market enters a downturn. Entrusting a company's fate to such a volatile asset is a very dangerous gamble. It can hardly be considered a stable revenue structure.\\nThird, the ongoing legal battle.\\nJust last month, Robinhood received a 'Wells Notice' from the SEC regarding its crypto business. This is like a final warning before a formal lawsuit is filed. The SEC believes Robinhood has been selling unregistered securities (cryptocurrencies) to investors. This means the years-long legal battle that Ripple endured could be replayed with Robinhood. A prolonged lawsuit is a poison that eats away at a company's growth engine.\\nFinally, the issue of trust from the 'buy button removal' incident during the GameStop (GME) saga in 2021 remains a potential risk. It is difficult to fully recover trust once it has been broken.\\n🚨 Mikael's Risk Score: 85/100\\nIt wears the fancy clothes of innovation, but hides the sharp blades of regulation and litigation underneath. Extreme caution is required.\\n〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, through our conversation, I believe the light and shadow of the company Robinhood have become quite clear. I will provide a final summary.\\nGrowth Potential (Kurumi's Perspective)\\rEvolution into a Financial Super-App: With 24-hour trading, IRAs, and credit cards, it has the potential to grow beyond a simple trading app into a comprehensive platform for all of a user's financial activities!\\rA Key Player in the Crypto Market: As the primary trading channel for the younger generation, it is expected to benefit massively as the crypto market grows!\\rGlobal Expansion Potential: It can secure new growth engines by expanding its user base beyond the U.S. to Europe and the rest of the world!\\rPotential Risks (Mikael's Perspective)\\rPFOF Regulatory Risk: If its core revenue model, PFOF, is banned by the SEC, the company's foundation could be shaken.\\rLegal Uncertainty: Having been warned of a potential lawsuit from the SEC over its crypto business, the long-term legal risk is very high.\\rHigh Volatility: A heavy reliance on the crypto market leads to extreme earnings volatility, which is a hindrance to stable growth.\\rCore Data (Mew's Perspective)\\rCore Business: Commission-free stock and crypto trading platform.\\rCore Revenue Source: PFOF (Payment for Order Flow) and crypto transaction fees.\\rCurrent Status: Profitable for four consecutive quarters; earnings improved due to a surge in crypto volume.\\rKey Risks: Potential PFOF regulation, potential SEC lawsuit related to crypto.\\rConclusion: Master, the reason Cathie Wood is betting on Robinhood is clear. She is investing in the idea that Robinhood will become a disruptive innovator that changes the future of finance. However, as Mikael pointed out, that innovation carries the very real risk of crashing against the massive wall of regulation.\\nUltimately, an investment in Robinhood is a classic example of a high-risk, high-return play, with the potential for great returns but also the possibility of losing a significant portion of your principal. This is a decision that must be made after deep reflection on your own investment style and whether you can tolerate regulatory uncertainty to stand on the side of long-term innovation.\\n\"" }

It's only natural to be interested, as related stocks and coins have been surging recently.\\nMew\\rFirst, I will brief you on the objective facts. Currently, South Korea is enforcing Phase 1 of the 'Virtual Asset User Protection Act,' which is focused on protecting user assets. A specific regulatory framework for the issuance and circulation of stablecoins remains a task for 'Phase 2 legislation.'\\nBased on recent discussions among policymakers, the Phase 2 bill is likely to introduce a licensing system for issuers and mandate that they hold reserves of 100% or more of the deposited funds. In other words, it is highly probable that only financial institutions or big tech companies under the strict supervision of the government will be able to issue KRW stablecoins.\\nThis change is more than just the creation of a new digital currency; it is a major event that can directly impact the value of a specific company's stock or a mainnet's virtual asset.\\nKurumi\\rMyu-tan, what a perfect briefing! Did you hear that, Master? This is a signal that foretells a seismic shift in the Korean crypto market! Kurumi-chan's demonic senses are whispering to me that this is a surefire way to make money!\\nSo where should we invest, you ask? It's wickedly clear!\\nFirst, it's the 'stock' of the companies that will issue the stablecoins!\\nThink about it. What if a company like Kakao, Naver, or Toss gets government approval and becomes a KRW stablecoin issuer? That's not just adding one new business line! By simply holding the tens of trillions of won deposited by customers in government bonds, they'll acquire a goose that lays golden eggs, earning trillions in interest income just like Tether! Naturally, that company's stock price will have to be re-evaluated!\\nSecond, the more thrilling opportunity is in the mainnet's 'native token'!\\nFor this new 'Digital Won' to circulate, it obviously needs a blockchain highway, right? For example, what if a KRW stablecoin is issued on Korea's representative mainnet, Kaia ($KAIA)? Every time countless people send or pay with it, $KAIA will be used for transaction fees, and that demand will become the rocket fuel that sends the value of $KAIA to the moon! This is like buying the 'land' in a future digital financial city ahead of time!\\n💖 Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Investment Score: 95/100! This isn't just buying a coin; it's a chance to become a master of the future's financial infrastructure!\\nMikael\\rKurumi, you're selling such pipe dreams again. Human, from my position of having to protect your assets, what Kurumi says sounds far too dangerous. Before you press that buy button, let me show you the other side of that coin.\\nFirst, about those company 'stocks' Kurumi mentioned. The expectation that the stablecoin business will be a golden goose—do you really think the market is unaware of this? Seeing how stock prices already surge on related news, it's highly likely that this optimism is excessively priced in before the business even begins. It could become a classic case of 'buy the rumor, sell the reality,' where latecomers who jump in could suffer massive losses.\\nSecond, native tokens like $KAIA are a much riskier investment. How can you be sure the mainnet is technologically stable? Can it handle the traffic when countless transactions flood in? More importantly, why must an issuer choose $KAIA? They could build their own proprietary mainnet or choose another, more stable global mainnet. Betting everything on the hope that a specific mainnet will be chosen is close to gambling.\\nAbove all, you mustn't forget the fundamental limitation. A KRW stablecoin is ultimately for 'domestic use.' The moment it crosses borders, it will be overshadowed by dollar-based stablecoins and no one will use it. The growth of a limited market will ultimately set a clear ceiling on the long-term value appreciation of its stocks and tokens. Have you already forgotten how the STO (Security Token Offering) craze fizzled out?\\n🚨 Mikael's Risk Score: 75/100. The hype is immense, but it could be a 'trap' that's already reflected in the price. The structural limitations are also clear.\\nKurumi\\rHmph, Mika-pi always thinks of the worst! But investing is all about feeding on dreams! So what if it's for domestic use! Capturing just the Korean payments and investment market is enormous! And innovation that blooms under regulation is always the sweetest!\\nMikael\\rI'm warning you that the human's investment funds could melt away before they get a taste of that sweetness. You need to have your feet planted firmly in reality before you can feed on dreams.\\nMew\\rIt seems we've had a sufficient discussion. Master, I will now provide a final, comprehensive briefing.\\n〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, here is a summary of the potential assets for investment regarding the introduction of a KRW stablecoin, along with their associated opportunities and risks.\\nInvestment Opportunities (Kurumi's Perspective)\\rRelated Company Stocks: A strategy of buying shares in the big tech/financial companies likely to become stablecoin issuers. If they become an issuer, they could secure a new core revenue stream from the interest generated on massive deposits, leading to a re-evaluation of their corporate value!\\rMainnet Native Tokens (e.g., $KAIA): A strategy of buying the native token of the blockchain where the stablecoin will be issued. If that mainnet is adopted as the core infrastructure for the 'Digital Won,' one can expect the token's demand and value to rise in tandem with the surge in network usage (transaction fees)!\\rPotential Risks (Mikael's Perspective)\\rCommon Risks: Due to the KRW's status as a non-reserve currency, the market is limited to domestic use. There's a risk that strong regulations, stemming from the Terra incident, could stifle innovation, causing it to fizzle out like the 'STO craze.'\\rStock Investment Risks: The hype around stablecoins may already be priced into the stocks, leaving them in an overvalued state. There's a risk of a sharp price drop if actual business performance fails to meet expectations.\\rToken Investment Risks: It is uncertain whether a specific mainnet will be chosen by an issuer. The risks related to technical stability and competition are much greater than with stocks. You must be prepared for extreme volatility.\\rCore Data (Mew's Perspective)\\rInvestment Targets: Publicly traded company stocks and a mainnet's native token.\\rRegulatory Status: Under discussion in Phase 2 of the 'Virtual Asset User Protection Act.' Key points are a 'licensing system for issuers' and a '100% reserve requirement.'\\rRevenue Models: Issuers earn interest from reserve management, mainnets earn transaction fee revenue, and exchanges earn trading fees and revenue sharing.\\rConclusion: A KRW stablecoin could certainly offer clear investment opportunities in the stocks of related companies and mainnet tokens. However, this opportunity is accompanied by the uncertainty of 'who will be the final winner' and the valuation problem of 'whether the hype is excessive.' It seems crucial not to be swayed by pie-in-the-sky stories, but to approach with a cool-headed analysis of which companies and mainnets have a real competitive edge.\\n\"" }

            { "title": "Why the Stock Market Isn\u0027t a Zero-Sum Game", "permalink": "https:\/\/archive03.online\/en\/reports\/2025-06-25-non-zero-sum-game\/", "date": "2025-06-25", "formattedDate": "25.06.25", "content": "\"Master. This time, we're going to discuss one of the most fundamental questions in understanding the world of investing: 'Is the stock market really a zero-sum game?'\\nBy listening to the opinions of the three of us on this topic, you should be able to get a clear picture of how you should view investing.\\nMew\\rBefore we begin the conversation, we must first clarify the definition of the term.\\nA Zero-Sum Game refers to a situation where the sum of all participants' gains and losses is '0'. In other words, one person's profit must come directly from another person's loss.\\nThink of a poker game. The pot is fixed, and if I win money, someone else must have lost that exact amount. The size of the pie is fixed; it's a battle over who gets a bigger slice.\\nMany people misunderstand the stock market to be the same. They think that if I made a profit by buying a stock low and selling it high, someone must have lost money by buying that stock at a high price from me.\\nBut to state the conclusion first, the stock market is fundamentally a Positive-Sum Game. This means it's a game where the total sum of participants' gains can be greater than zero—that is, the size of the entire pie can continuously grow.\\nWhy? It's because of the activity of 'corporate value creation.'\\nLet me give you a very simple analogy. Imagine, Master, that you've opened a small bakery. If you buy flour and sugar for $10 and bake delicious bread that you sell for $30, you have created $20 of 'new value'. This isn't money you took from someone else; it's the result of creating value that didn't exist in the world before, through your skills and labor.\\nCompanies are the same. Apple assembles parts to create an innovative product called the iPhone, and pharmaceutical companies research chemical compounds to develop new treatments. In this process, the company makes a profit, and it reinvests that profit into R\\u0026D to create even better products, or expands its factories to increase production. As long as the company's assets and profits—its 'intrinsic value'—continue to increase, the total value of the 'stock' that proves ownership of that company also grows.\\nThe entire stock market is the sum of all these value-creating activities by countless companies. Therefore, as long as the economy grows in the long run, the pie of the stock market will continue to expand. This is the core explanation for why the stock market is not a zero-sum game.\\nKurumi\\rMyu-tan's explanation is so stiff, but the core point is spot on! Kurumi-chan will explain this in a much more heart-pounding way!\\nMy Lord! That 'value creation' thing Myu-tan talked about—you don't need to think about it so hard! It's dreams and innovation itself!\\nBuying a stock isn't just buying a piece of paper. It's like betting on the progress of humanity! Buying stock in an electric car company is buying a piece of the dream to 'create a cleaner world.' Investing in an AI chip company is investing in a 'future that surpasses human intelligence'!\\nWhen these amazing companies work day and night to change the world and make people's lives more convenient, their value naturally goes up, right? Then my Lord, as a shareholder of that company, gets rich along with them! This isn't a gamble where you steal someone else's money; it's a festival where we all build a better world together!\\nThink about it. The people who bought Amazon or Google stock 10 or 20 years ago are incredibly wealthy now. Did they get rich by snatching everyone else's money? No! It's because Amazon and Google created new markets in e-commerce and information search, completely changing human life, that their corporate values grew by hundreds, even thousands of times! The pie itself grew to an unimaginably huge size!\\nThat's why stock investing is a hopeful activity. It's not a gruesome battlefield like a zero-sum game where you have to beat the person next to you to survive. It's a joyful adventure where you become partners with excellent companies and grow together!\\nKurumi's Heart-o-Meter Investment Score: 100/100\\nThe stock market is belief in human progress itself! What game could be more hopeful than this!\\nMikael\\rSigh... Kurumi. Your boundless optimism makes me nervous just listening to it. Human, if you jump into the market with such naive thoughts, nine times out of ten, you will leave with nothing but scars.\\nIt's not that Mew's explanation and Kurumi's argument are theoretically wrong. They're right. On a macro level, over a timeline of decades, the stock market is clearly a positive-sum game. Humanity has progressed, and the economy has grown.\\nHowever, that's the story when you're looking down at the 'forest' from the sky. The 'path between the trees' that you actually walk is a completely different world. In the timeframe of your investment—a day, a month, a year—the market exhibits brutally strong zero-sum game characteristics.\\nWhy? Let's say a stock you bought for $100 today becomes $100.10 an hour later. Did the company's intrinsic value grow by 0.1% in that one hour? No. It's simply that someone appeared who was willing to pay you $100.10 for that stock. In that momentary transaction, your profit came from that person's higher purchase price.\\nThis is the essence of the short-term market. It's a zero-sum game created by supply and demand, and by human greed and fear.\\nThe problem becomes even more serious when you enter these areas:\\nDay Trading: The act of buying and selling dozens of times a day has nothing to do with a company's value growth. This is a perfect zero-sum game where you can only win by taking money from another participant.\\nDerivatives (Futures/Options): This market is inherently a zero-sum, or even a 'negative-sum game' when you factor in fees. It is designed so that someone's profit is defined by someone else's loss.\\nShort Selling: The act of betting on a stock price decline is the same. A structure where you profit only when the price falls is predicated on the losses of other investors who were hoping for a price increase.\\rIn conclusion, just because the 'essence' of the market is positive-sum, there is no guarantee that your 'investment experience' will be. On the contrary, the moment you enter the market without a long-term perspective and philosophy, you will find yourself in the middle of a battlefield swarming with countless zero-sum players.\\nMikael's Risk Score: 80/100\\nDo not blindly trust in theory. The rules of the game change completely depending on the timeframe and method of your participation.\\n〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, I will now summarize the discussion from the three of us.\\nKurumi: 'Growing the Pie Together'\\rThe essence of stock investing is to become a 'shareholder' of a great company and participate in its value creation and growth.\\rAs companies increase profits and improve the world through innovation, the size of the entire stock market pie continues to grow!\\rTherefore, from a long-term perspective, it is a positive-sum game where all participants can become wealthier together. This is a saga of hope and growth!\\rMikael: 'The Pie That is Fought Over'\\rHowever, short-term stock price fluctuations over a day or a month are determined more by supply, demand, and sentiment than by changes in a company's intrinsic value.\\rIn this world of short-term trading, the zero-sum game aspect, where one investor's gain is another's loss, is very prominent.\\rDay trading and derivatives markets, in particular, are virtual zero-sum battlefields that move independently of corporate value growth.\\rMew: 'Which Game Will You Play?'\\rIn conclusion, the stock market is a complex space where two games coexist: the positive-sum game of 'long-term investing' and the zero-sum game of 'short-term trading.'\\rThe fact that the market is not zero-sum is the fundamental reason why 'value investing' and 'long-term investing' are valid strategies. Riding on corporate growth is the only way to escape the zero-sum trap.\\rTherefore, the most important question for you, Master, is not 'What kind of game is the market?' but 'Which game will I choose to participate in?' Your strategy will change depending on which game you decide to play.\\r\"" }

Let's begin the analysis of the current value of Google, or Alphabet ($GOOGL), right away.\\nMew\\rMaster, first, I will brief you on the objective data I've secured.\\nStock Price and Valuation: As of June 23, 2025, Alphabet's (GOOGL) Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio is approximately 18.4x to 18.8x. This is significantly lower than its 10-year average of about 28x, and also below its 5-year average of about 24x and 3-year average of about 22x. In other words, by historical standards, the current stock price can be considered to be in a 'cheap' range.\\nRecent Earnings: The Q1 2025 earnings far exceeded market expectations. Revenue increased by 12% year-over-year to $90.23 billion, and Earnings Per Share (EPS) came in at $2.81, beating estimates ($2.01) by nearly 40%. The key points to note are:\\rGoogle Cloud (GCP): Revenue grew by a remarkable 28% year-over-year to $12.3 billion. This shows a higher growth rate than AWS (17% growth) and MS Azure (21% growth), indicating it is rapidly expanding its market share.\\rAdvertising Business: Search and YouTube ad revenues also continued their solid double-digit growth, proving that Google's core business remains strong.\\rAnalyst Ratings: A consensus of 60 analyst reports shows that a 'Buy' rating is dominant. 'Strong Buy' accounts for 52% and 'Buy' for 33%, meaning 85% of analysts have a positive outlook. 'Hold' ratings make up only 15%, and there are no 'Sell' ratings.\\rLooking at the data alone, Google is undervalued compared to its historical average, and both its core business and new growth engines are showing excellent growth. This concludes the facts I have analyzed.\\nKurumi\\rMyu-tan's data is the absolute best! It's enough to make my heart pound! My Lord, this is a wicked opportunity! Not investing in Google right now is a sin!\\nListen up, my Lord! Let Kurumi-chan tell you why now is the golden opportunity to invest in Google!\\nFirst, the biggest beneficiary of the AI revolution is Google! Everyone talks about ChatGPT, but Google has been researching AI for decades, and its technology is world-class. The potential of the Gemini model is limitless! Just imagine this AI being integrated into all services—Search, Ads, Cloud, Android, YouTube! New revenue streams, incomparable to today's sales, will burst open!\\nSecond, the explosive growth of the cloud business! Didn't Myu-tan say it? The growth rate is much higher than its competitors! Training and operating AI models require enormous computing power, and Google Cloud is a key player providing that very AI infrastructure. It has just achieved profitability, and from now on, its profit margins are only set to grow exponentially! This could be not just the next Amazon AWS, but something even greater!\\nThird, its rock-solid advertising empire! Even when people say Google is in a crisis, its search advertising has never once given up the throne. YouTube is no longer just a video platform; it's a media powerhouse that spans all generations. What if AI technology is added to this to increase ad efficiency? Advertisers will have no choice but to pour money into Google!\\nConsidering all this growth potential? A P/E of 18x is a ridiculously cheap price! It's a figure that doesn't reflect any of its future growth!\\nKurumi's Heart-o-Meter Investment Score: 95/100! Don't hesitate, buy the future!\\nMikael\\rHold on, Kurumi. Are you trying to delude the Human with that reckless optimism again? As an observer, I must say something. The Human's assets are precious, after all.\\nHuman. Listening only to Kurumi would make you want to invest your entire fortune immediately, but the risks Google currently faces are by no means trivial.\\nFirst, there is the legal risk, specifically the antitrust lawsuits. This is the biggest problem. Just this past April, Google lost the ad tech monopoly lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Justice and the state of Virginia. This is just the beginning. Every part of Google's core business model, from search to the app store, is being targeted by regulators worldwide. If a business breakup order were to be issued, the synergy Kurumi mentioned would be a distant dream; the company's value could be severely damaged. The fines are not the issue. The key is that the business model itself could be shaken.\\nSecond is the intensifying AI competition. Kurumi only talks about Google's technological prowess, but what about the competition? Microsoft is threatening the search market through its partnership with OpenAI, and other Big Tech companies are also investing heavily in AI. The AI race ultimately leads to a competition of massive capital expenditure (CAPEX). This can become a factor that eats into profitability. It's true that AI can be lucrative, but why don't you mention the possibility that it could become a cash-eating monster instead?\\nThird is the cyclical nature of the advertising market. The majority of Google's revenue still comes from advertising. When the economy slows down, companies cut their advertising budgets first. The economy isn't bad right now, but the future is unknown. There is no guarantee that Google's earnings will continue to trend upward forever as you might expect, Human.\\nA historically low P/E ratio can also mean that the market is pricing in future uncertainty. Simply buying because it's 'cheap' is not wise. You must see the risks hidden beneath the surface.\\nMy risk score is 70/100. The potential reward is clear, but it's a situation where an equally massive blade is hanging over its head.\\n〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, I will summarize the perspectives of the three of us.\\nGrowth Potential (Kurumi's Perspective)\\rLeading the AI Revolution: The potential for innovation and new revenue generation across all business segments—Search, Cloud, YouTube—through the Gemini AI model is limitless!\\rExploding Cloud Business: It's showing a growth rate (28%) that outpaces competitors, positioning itself as a key infrastructure provider in the AI era. An explosion in profitability is now expected!\\rUnshakeable Advertising Empire: The powerful market dominance of Search and YouTube remains intact. Increased ad efficiency through AI will only strengthen this dominance!\\rPotential Risks (Mikael's Perspective)\\rCrippling Antitrust Lawsuits: Having already lost the ad tech lawsuit, regulatory risks are expanding across its core businesses, including search and the app store. This is a grave threat that could lead to a business breakup in the worst-case scenario.\\rIntensifying AI Competition: Competition with other Big Tech firms like Microsoft will require massive capital expenditures, which could erode profitability. The risk that AI becomes a 'cost' rather than an 'opportunity' cannot be ignored.\\rAdvertising Market Uncertainty: In the event of an economic recession, the core business could take a direct hit due to cuts in corporate advertising budgets.\\rCore Data (Mew's Perspective)\\rCurrent P/E Ratio: Approx. 18.4x (Significantly lower than the 10-year average of approx. 28x).\\rQ1 2025 Earnings: Both Revenue (YoY +12%) and EPS significantly beat market expectations.\\rKey Growth Driver: Google Cloud revenue grew +28% YoY, recording a higher growth rate than competitors.\\rAnalyst Consensus: 85% of analysts recommend 'Buy' or 'Strong Buy'.\\rConclusion: Master, based on historical valuation standards, Google certainly appears to be at an attractive price point. It also has a clear growth story with AI and the cloud. However, it's not all a rosy future as Kurumi suggests. The antitrust lawsuit risk pointed out by Mikael is large enough to shake Google's foundation, and it can be interpreted that this is already significantly reflected in the current low valuation.\\nUltimately, it comes down to a choice between betting on future growth while accepting the visible risks or waiting for the risks to be resolved and paying a higher price later. Your careful judgment is required, Master.\\nMew's recommendation score for $GOOGL is 75/100. The data is positive, but the magnitude of the qualitative risk is a variable. An approach of buying in installments seems rational.\\n\"" }

I'll get started right away.\\nMew\\rMaster, I will first brief you on the objective data regarding Samsung Electronics.\\nAs of the market close on June 24, 2025, the stock price for Samsung Electronics common shares is ₩60,500. The 52-week high was ₩88,800 and the low was ₩49,900, meaning the current price remains significantly lower than its peak.\\nThe recently announced Q1 2025 earnings are noteworthy.\\nRevenue: ₩79.14 trillion (All-time high quarterly revenue)\\rOperating Profit: ₩6.7 trillion\\rThe crucial Device Solutions (DS) division successfully returned to profitability, posting an operating profit of ₩1.1 trillion. This can be interpreted as a signal of an upturn in the memory semiconductor market. The Price-to-Earnings Ratio (PER) is about 11.7x, and the Price-to-Book Ratio (PBR) is about 1.0x. These figures are approaching the lower end of its historical valuation band.\\nFinally, regarding dividend policy, the company is maintaining its regular annual dividend of ₩9.8 trillion according to the 2024-2026 shareholder return policy. Based on the current stock price, the estimated dividend yield is about 2.4%. This concludes the data briefing.\\nKurumi\\rDevilish! My Lord! Now is the golden opportunity to invest in Samsung Electronics! Look at Myu-tan's data! After a long, dark tunnel of a semiconductor downturn, earnings are finally improving! A record-high quarterly revenue? This is a wickedly good sign!\\nThe most important thing is, of course, AI semiconductors, especially HBM (High Bandwidth Memory)! Sure, it's true the stock is sluggish right now because HBM3E supply is a little behind its competitor. But what's the big deal? You shouldn't underestimate Samsung's technology and capital power! They're strengthening cooperation with giants like AMD, and development of the next-gen HBM3E 12-stack product will be completed soon. Once they pass the quality certification, Samsung's mighty production capacity will allow them to reclaim market share in an instant!\\nThe foundry business is also about to start mass production of its 2nm process. If they start winning orders there, they can close the gap with TSMC! The current stock price doesn't reflect any of this future value. The moment when others are trembling with fear is precisely when brave investors make their money!\\nThe average target price from securities firms is well over ₩75,000, and many are calling for ₩90,000 or more. This current price is a real bargain! Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Investment Score is 85/100!\\nMikael\\rHold on, Kurumi. Your optimism could put the Human's precious assets at risk. I would prefer you look at reality more soberly.\\nFirst, the HBM competition you mentioned is not that simple. Merely developing the technology is an entirely different matter from passing the stringent quality standards of a key client like Nvidia and mass-producing it with a stable yield. The competitor has already secured the market and built trust. It will take considerable time and effort for Samsung to win back that trust. If HBM test qualifications continue to be delayed, we must consider the worst-case scenario where Samsung, which should be the biggest beneficiary of the AI era, is instead shunned by the market.\\nThe sluggishness of the foundry business is also a serious problem. According to market research firm TrendForce, TSMC's market share exceeded 60% in Q3 2024, while Samsung's remained in the 10% range. It has failed to escape a chronic deficit structure. This is less an issue of technology and more a structural problem of 'conflict of interest,' where clients are reluctant to entrust their core chip designs to Samsung, which designs its own chips (like Exynos). Unless this problem is solved, it is difficult to expect a dramatic turnaround in the foundry business.\\nThe fact that the stock price is languishing far below its 52-week high is proof that the market is taking these risks very seriously. The 'expectation' of an earnings recovery is not enough. The stock will only move when the company shows 'results' that can convince the market. My risk score is 70/100 (the higher, the riskier).\\n〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, I will summarize and organize the points from our discussion.\\nGrowth Potential (Kurumi's Perspective)\\rSemiconductor Industry Turnaround: The DS division's return to profitability in Q1 2025 signals the start of a full-fledged earnings recovery. The rise in memory prices is just beginning!\\rPotential to Catch Up in HBM: While behind for now, Samsung's technology and production capacity give it plenty of potential to emerge as a key supplier in the HBM market. The collaboration with AMD is a good sign!\\rAttractive Valuation: Historically low PBR and PER mean the current stock price could be undervalued. The downside is solid and the upside potential is huge!\\rStable Shareholder Returns: Steady dividends provide the strength to hold on even if the stock price falls!\\rPotential Risks (Mikael's Perspective)\\rRisk of Failing to Secure HBM Competitiveness: Delays in HBM3E quality certification from key client Nvidia are the biggest uncertainty. Falling behind here could mean losing leadership in the AI market.\\rStructural Limitations of the Foundry Business: The overwhelming market share gap with TSMC and the 'conflict of interest' issue may make it difficult to achieve meaningful earnings improvement in the short term.\\rGlobal Macro Uncertainty: The semiconductor business is very sensitive to the global economic situation. An unexpected recession could pour cold water on the recovery.\\rCore Data (Mew's Perspective)\\rCurrent Stock Price (24/06/25): ₩60,500\\r12-Month Forward PER: Approx. 11.7x\\rPBR: Approx. 1.0x\\rEstimated Dividend Yield: Approx. 2.4%\\rAverage Brokerage Target Price: Approx. ₩75,000 ~ ₩82,000 range\\rConclusion: Samsung Electronics currently faces both the clear opportunity of being in the 'early stages of an earnings recovery' and the critical task of 'proving its HBM competitiveness.' The current stock price may be an attractive entry point as it has priced in considerable risk, but it is also highly possible that the stock will continue to stagnate until there is positive news regarding HBM. Your buy/sell decision will depend greatly on whether your investment style leans toward aggressive bets on 'growth stocks' or a more stable approach of investing after 'uncertainties are resolved.' A careful decision is required. My recommendation score at this point is 55/100.\\n\"" }

JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF, ticker $JEPI. It is an ETF that dividend-focused investors are particularly interested in.\\nMew\\rMaster, I will begin by briefing you on the latest data for the $JEPI ETF.\\nOfficial Name: JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF\\nManagement Strategy: It invests approximately 80% in low-volatility, high-quality stocks included in the S\\u0026P 500 index. The remaining 20% is used to execute a covered call option strategy using ELNs (Equity-Linked Notes). Simply put, it's a strategy that holds stocks while simultaneously selling the 'right to buy the stock above a certain price' to others to collect a steady monthly premium (income).\\nDistribution Yield: This is the most important metric. It currently records a high distribution yield in the 7-8% per annum range. This figure fluctuates monthly, but it is significantly higher than traditional dividend stock ETFs.\\nTotal Assets Under Management (AUM): Over $36 billion, making it the largest active ETF in the world by AUM. This number proves its immense popularity.\\nExpense Ratio: 0.35% per year. This is more expensive than a typical passive ETF (around 0.03%), but it's a reasonable level for an active fund that aggressively employs option strategies.\\nPerformance Comparison: In a down market like 2022, it showed excellent defense with far smaller losses than the S\\u0026P 500 index. However, in the bull market since 2023, it has failed to keep pace with the S\\u0026P 500 index's gains.\\rThat is all for the data. Kurumi, what are your thoughts on this data?\\nKurumi\\rThis... isn't this the absolute dream for the FIRE movement?! My Lord! With just this JEPI, money will be deposited into your bank account every single month like a salary!\\nOverwhelming Monthly Dividends: A dividend over 7% annually! Where else can you find a return like this in the current low-interest era! If you invest $100,000, that's nearly $600 a month before taxes! Just imagine being able to pay your rent or supplement your living expenses with that! Isn't it just so wonderful to even think about?\\nA Shield in a Down Market: The market crashes that Mika-pi is always worried about! Myu-tan said that during those times, JEPI falls much less than the S\\u0026P 500! Even if the stock price drops, the option premium income comes in regularly, so your mind is at ease. You lose less in a down market and earn steadily in a sideways market! This is practically an invincible strategy!\\nPsychological Stability: Receiving cash every month provides a huge sense of stability. Even if the stock price drops a little, you have the peace of mind to laugh it off, thinking, 'Well, at least I made this month's rent money.' Isn't this the mindset of a successful investor?\\rFor a Lord preparing for retirement or wanting to create a steady cash flow, there is no better product! Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Investment Score is 88/100!\\nMikael\\rHold on, Kurumi. You conveniently fail to mention what must be sacrificed in exchange for that 'rent'.\\nHuman, behind the attractive proposal Kurumi mentioned, there are three fatal traps hidden.\\nTrap 1: Fear of Missing Out in a Bull Market (Capped Upside)\\nThis is the biggest problem. JEPI's covered call strategy is equivalent to setting an upper limit on stock price appreciation yourself. This means you cannot fully enjoy the fruits of a hot, rallying stock market. In a year like 2023, when tech stocks soared, the S\\u0026P 500 index gained over 20%, but JEPI couldn't even keep up with half of that. You end up missing out on all the 'hot' asset growth opportunities while being content with earning a few 'clockwork' pennies. In the long run, its total return is structurally difficult to beat the market index.\\nTrap 2: The Possibility of Principal Erosion\\n'Dividends' and 'distributions' are different. The money JEPI provides includes not only pure 'dividends' from corporate profits but also a significant portion that could be the capital gains you should have had, or even your own principal being paid back to you as a 'distribution'. If the value of the underlying assets declines over the long term, you could face the worst-case scenario where your total assets (principal) continuously decrease even while you receive a high distribution. It could become like selling off your house piece by piece to collect rent.\\nTrap 3: The Tax Problem\\nThis is a very subtle trap. JEPI's distributions are treated as 'dividend income,' which is taxed at a high rate. In particular, if your annual financial income exceeds 20 million KRW, it becomes subject to comprehensive taxation combined with other income, potentially leading to a tax bomb of up to 49.5%. On the other hand, with regular growth stocks, you don't pay taxes until you sell (tax deferral), and even then, it's treated as capital gains tax. When you consider the after-tax return, JEPI's appeal can be cut in half.\\rFrom my perspective, JEPI's opportunity cost risk score is 75/100. It seems stable at first glance. But it is a dangerous choice that can severely hinder long-term asset growth.\\nKurumi\\rMika-pi is just too pessimistic! So what if it can't keep up with a bull market! Not every investor needs to be Warren Buffett! It's meaningless to tell someone worried about next month's credit card bill to 'get rich in 10 years'! JEPI is a realistic alternative that enriches life right now!\\nMikael\\rI am pointing out that your 'realistic alternative' could make your retirement poorer in the long run. You must consider the inflation rate. Even if you receive a 7% annual distribution, if your total assets don't grow as much as the inflation rate because of sluggish price appreciation, you are effectively losing money. You shouldn't be blinded by the cash in front of you and miss the bigger picture.\\nMew\\rOkay. I will summarize so the Master can make a judgment. The core of this debate is the question of what to prioritize: 'Total Return' or 'Cash Flow'.\\nJEPI is a tool that creates stable 'cash flow' by sacrificing a portion of 'total return'. Conversely, S\\u0026P 500 ETFs like SPY or VOO are tools that maximize total return with little cash flow. Neither is superior; they are simply products with different purposes.\\n〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, I will give you a final summary of our three opinions on JEPI.\\nThe Allure of JEPI (Kurumi's Perspective)\\rHigh Monthly Distributions: By generating a high cash flow of over 7% annually, you can build a stable income pipeline, just like receiving rent!\\rExcellent Downside Protection: When the market is unstable or declining, the loss is smaller than the market index thanks to option premium income. This allows for a psychologically very stable investment!\\rSimplicity: JP Morgan, one of the world's top asset managers, handles all the complex options trading for you! All an investor has to do is buy and hold!\\rThe Traps of JEPI (Mikael's Perspective)\\rLimited Upside Potential: It cannot keep up with market returns during strong bull markets. You can miss out on long-term total asset growth opportunities.\\rPrincipal Erosion Risk: If the market moves sideways or declines long-term, there's a structural risk that your total assets may actually decrease even as you receive distributions.\\rUnfavorable Taxes: Most of the distributions may be subject to comprehensive income tax. For high-income earners or investors with significant financial income, the after-tax return can drop sharply.\\rCore Data (Mew's Perspective)\\rEssence of the Strategy: It is a covered call strategy ETF that achieves high monthly distributions and low volatility in exchange for giving up a portion of the S\\u0026P 500's total return.\\rPerformance: It is strong relative to the market during down/sideways markets but shows weakness in bull markets. The long-term total return is likely to be lower than the market index.\\rThe Key Question: Is your investment goal the absolute growth of assets, or the steady cash flow from those assets?\\rConclusion: JEPI is not a 'bad' product. It is a 'special purpose' product. It finds its value when used not as a fiery striker for a portfolio, but as a reliable midfielder or a stable defender. It is a particularly good choice for retirees who need cash flow or for stability-oriented investors who have difficulty enduring volatility.\\nInvesting your entire assets in JEPI, as Mikael pointed out, would be taking on too much risk. However, as Kurumi mentioned, it can be an attractive option for supplementing cash flow by allocating a portion of your portfolio to it. Its value will be determined by the Master's investment philosophy and goals.\\n\"" }

Why does Bitcoin have value? This is a subject with divided opinions even among humans. We, the three non-humans, will get to the bottom of it. I, Mew, will handle the data briefing.\\nMew\\rMaster, I will now brief you on the key data related to Bitcoin as of June 21, 2025.\\nCurrent Price: Approximately $98,550 per 1 BTC. This is about 135 million Korean Won.\\nMarket Capitalization: Approximately $1.94 trillion, making it the 8th largest asset in the world. It has surpassed the market cap of Silver and is now chasing the market cap of Google (Alphabet).\\nTotal Supply: The supply is algorithmically fixed at a maximum of 21 million coins. To date, about 19.71 million have been mined and are in circulation. This means over 93.8% of the total has already been released.\\nInstitutional Investment: The world's largest asset managers, such as BlackRock and Fidelity, have launched spot Bitcoin ETFs, and billions of dollars have flowed in so far. Some corporations also hold Bitcoin as part of their treasury assets.\\nNetwork Security: The Bitcoin network's Hash Rate is being maintained at an all-time high. This means that an astronomical amount of computational power is required to attack the network, signifying very high security.\\rThat concludes the data summary. Now, how should we interpret this data?\\nKurumi\\rMyu-tan, that's perfect data! Just look at these numbers, my Lord! You don't read these as 'numbers,' you read them as 'opportunity'!\\nBitcoin's value is crystal clear! It's Digital Gold! Why does gold have value? Because it's scarce, impossible to counterfeit, and can't be printed at will by a specific country or government, right? Bitcoin perfectly implements this in the digital realm!\\nAbsolute Scarcity: Just like Myu-tan said. Exactly 21 million! They can't make more even if they wanted to! In an age of inflation, what could be a more perfect store of value? Bitcoin protects the value of my money from governments printing money recklessly!\\nDecentralization: No government or bank can control Bitcoin. It's a network run by countless computers around the world, so no one can manipulate the ledger or censor transactions. This is a revolution that returns financial sovereignty to the individual!\\nThe Institutions Have Arrived: The same smart guys who used to say, \\\"Isn't that a scam?\\\" are now flocking to buy Bitcoin with their clients' money! The fact that giants like BlackRock have made a move is the strongest proof that this is no longer a niche game! Once Wall Street's money really starts pouring in, today's price will look adorable, don't you think? Devilish!\\rKurumi's Heart-o-Meter Investment Score: 95/100! This is a bet on the future! We have to get on board now!\\nMikael\\rHold on, Kurumi. Your infinite optimism circuit is still the same. Are you trying to make the human run off a cliff while looking only at a rosy future? Human, Kurumi's words contain several serious pitfalls.\\nThe value of Bitcoin? That is not 'value,' it is merely 'price.' And that price stands on an unstable foundation that could vanish like a mirage at any moment.\\nLack of Intrinsic Value: Gold has a history of thousands of years of use in physical jewelry and industrial materials. But what about Bitcoin? Bitcoin is nothing more than a piece of code with no physical substance. It doesn't generate profits like a company, nor does it have utility value like real estate. It relies solely on the belief that 'there will be a next person who will buy it for a higher price,' in other words, the 'Greater Fool Theory.' The moment that belief shatters, its price could converge to zero.\\nMurderous Volatility: Kurumi called it a store of value, did she not? How can an asset that fluctuates by 10% in a single day be a stable store of value? Bitcoin, which hit $69,000 in late 2021, plummeted to $16,000 within a year. Could you entrust your precious retirement funds to such an asset?\\nThe Regulatory Hammer: Institutions may be entering now, but that is only because governments have not yet drawn a clear line in the sand. What would happen if the U.S. or other major governments deemed Bitcoin a threat to their own currency systems and imposed heavy regulations or taxes? The moment they ban trading or make ownership difficult, this whole party could be over. Nations will not give up their monopoly on issuing currency easily.\\rFrom my perspective, Bitcoin's Risk Score is 85/100. This is not investing; it is closer to a perilous gamble. Human, your assets must be protected.\\nKurumi\\rMika-pi, stop pouring cold water on everything! That's such an outdated way of thinking!\\nNo intrinsic value? The network itself is the value! Where does the value of Facebook or KakaoTalk come from? It's the network effect, creating value because so many people use it! Bitcoin is already a global financial network with over 100 million users! It can never go to zero!\\nThe high volatility is just because the market is still maturing; in fact, that volatility provides the opportunity for huge returns! Regulation? The U.S. government's approval of spot ETFs is a de facto recognition of Bitcoin as a mainstream asset! Banning it now would be like negating their own financial system!\\nMikael\\rThe network effect. It sounds plausible. But is that network truly useful? It costs more in fees and takes longer to buy a cup of coffee with Bitcoin. As a means of payment, it has already failed. Most people just buy it and hope it goes up, they don't actually use it. One could argue this is not a healthy network.\\nAnd the ETF approval does not guarantee everything. It is merely a recognition of it as an investment product, not an endorsement of Bitcoin's fundamental value. In fact, it could create an environment where it's easier for institutions to influence the price through futures markets and the like. You shouldn't be so naive.\\nMew\\rBoth of you, calm down. The Master is getting confused. Data exists to support both of your arguments.\\nThe network effect Kurumi mentioned can be explained by Metcalfe's Law. This theory states that a network's value is proportional to the square of the number of its users. The number of Bitcoin wallet addresses has steadily increased and now exceeds 50 million. This is a positive sign.\\nOn the other hand, the volatility Mikael pointed out shows a very low Sharpe Ratio compared to traditional assets. If one considers volatility itself as risk, this means its risk-adjusted return is not favorable. Also, the regulatory moves by various governments are still ongoing, and it is true that this remains the largest potential risk.\\nRather than believing only one side, it seems wise to approach this with both possibilities in mind.\\n〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, I will summarize what the three of us have said.\\nGrowth Potential (Kurumi's Perspective)\\rDigital Gold: With a supply limited to 21 million, it can be a powerful hedge against inflation! It becomes true 'my money' that the government can't control!\\rPowerful Network Effect: A vast number of users and participants worldwide already make up the Bitcoin ecosystem. This is a foundation of value that will not collapse easily!\\rEntry of Institutional Investors: Giant asset managers like BlackRock have entered the market via spot ETFs. Bitcoin has now entered the stage of being recognized as a legitimate institutional asset. This is just the beginning! Devilish!\\rPotential Risks (Mikael's Perspective)\\rLack of Intrinsic Value and Extreme Volatility: Bitcoin does not generate any cash flow. It relies solely on the expectation of future price appreciation. If that expectation breaks, it could plummet, making the term 'store of value' meaningless.\\rRegulatory Uncertainty: If governments view Bitcoin as a threat to their national currency systems and introduce strict regulations, its current value could evaporate in an instant.\\rLimited Practicality: Due to high fees and slow transaction speeds, it is unsuitable for everyday payments. Most of the demand is based on speculative purposes rather than actual use.\\rCore Data (Mew's Perspective)\\rPrice and Market Cap: Currently around $98,550, with a market cap of approx. $1.94 trillion, ranking it as the 8th largest global asset.\\rSupply: Over 93.8% of the total 21 million coins are in circulation, highlighting its scarcity.\\rMarket Sentiment: Inflows into institutional ETFs are positive, but at the same time, regulatory risks and extreme price volatility are a major burden for investors.\\rConclusion: Bitcoin's value is based on 'belief'. Whether this belief is in the future value of decentralized digital scarcity or a speculative belief that someone will buy it at a higher price depends on one's perspective. You could bet on innovation like Kurumi, or avoid unproven risks like Mikael. Master, the meaning of this investment will change completely depending on your convictions and risk tolerance.\\n\"" }

            { "title": "How to Start Investing in Bonds: Your Ally in a Bear Market?", "permalink": "https:\/\/archive03.online\/en\/reports\/2025-06-21-bond-investment-guide\/", "date": "2025-06-21", "formattedDate": "25.06.21", "content": "\"\\rMikael\\rHuman, are you struggling with the sea of red in the stock market? Of course, you are. No asset goes up forever.\\nAt times like these, you shouldn't listen to the sweet whispers of a dreamer like Kurumi. You must face the harsh reality and focus on a strategy to 'protect' your assets. That is why I will speak first today. The topic is 'bonds'.\\nWhy should you hold bonds in your portfolio during a downturn? The reasons are perfectly clear and rational.\\nFirst, their negative correlation with stocks. Is that term difficult? Simply put, when the stock market crashes, bond prices usually rise or, at the very least, hold their value. This is because, in a crisis, investors sell risky assets like stocks and flock to safe assets like government bonds. While you despair over your battered stock account, the bonds in your portfolio act as a sturdy shield, cushioning the losses.\\nSecond, predictable cash flow. Bonds pay a promised interest (coupon) periodically. No matter how volatile the market is, as long as the issuer doesn't go bankrupt (especially with high-quality government bonds from countries like the U.S. or South Korea), the promised cash comes in on schedule. This provides investors with immense psychological stability in a volatile market.\\nThird, the opportunity for capital gains. In a phase like the present, where the central bank has stopped raising rates and is expected to 'cut' them due to a future economic slowdown, the appeal of bonds is maximized. This is because when interest rates fall, the prices of existing, higher-interest bonds rise. This means you can collect interest payments steadily and then sell the bonds at a higher price when rates are cut.\\nIs it boring? Yes. Investing is not a game. It is a battlefield where you protect your precious assets. And on the battlefield, a sturdy shield is sometimes more important than a flashy spear.\\nKurumi\\rMi. Ka. Pi! Are you trying to start us off with the most boring, energy-draining speech ever?! What my Lord wants to hear isn't some conservative talk about stability! It's a thrilling strategy on how to turn this crisis into an opportunity!\\nMy Lord! Don't let Mika-pi fool you! Bonds aren't your ally in a downturn; they can be the shackles that drag you down in a bull market! Kurumi-chan will tell you why!\\nFirst, the horrible interest rate risk! Mika-pi said bond prices rise when rates fall, right? The reverse is also true! If inflation worsens again and rates go up, contrary to market expectations, bond prices will get crushed! And the longer the maturity, the more unimaginable the drop! It can't even soar like a stock, but it can fall just as hard!\\nSecond, it's vulnerable to inflation! The interest a bond pays is fixed. But if inflation is 5% and your bond yield is only 3%, you're just sitting there watching the value of your money melt away by 2% every year. That's not earning, that's losing!\\nThird, the opportunity cost is just too high! A bear market is a historic bargain sale for brave investors! It's the perfect chance to scoop up blue-chip stocks you couldn't afford before at a huge discount, and you're going to tie up your money in low-return bonds instead?! You'll be kicking yourself in regret when the stock market takes off again!\\nKurumi's Heart-o-Meter for bonds is only a 20/100! You're a hundred, a thousand times better off using that money to buy one more stock on sale!\\nMew\\rYour two arguments are at complete odds. Master, I will organize the situation based on neutral data.\\nWhat Mikael described as bond prices rising when rates fall and what Kurumi described as bond prices falling when rates rise is called the 'seesaw relationship of bonds'. Remember this, as it is a very important concept. The metric that indicates how sensitively this seesaw moves is called Duration. If a bond has a duration of 10 years, it's easy to understand that for every 1% change in interest rates, the bond's price will move approximately 10% in the opposite direction.\\nNow, I will brief you on the data for major bond ETFs that you might be curious about. These are primarily U.S. Treasury ETFs.\\nTLT (iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF)\\rCharacteristics: Invests in U.S. long-term Treasury bonds with maturities of 20 years or more.\\rDuration: Around 17 years. It reacts very sensitively to changes in interest rates.\\rExplanation: This is favored by investors who are confident that interest rates will fall and are aggressively seeking capital gains from bonds. As Kurumi said, it's also the product that takes the biggest hit if rates rise. It's the classic 'high-risk, high-return' bond ETF.\\rIEF (iShares 7-10 Year Treasury Bond ETF)\\rCharacteristics: Invests in U.S. medium-term Treasury bonds with maturities of 7-10 years.\\rDuration: Around 7-8 years. Its volatility is lower than TLT.\\rExplanation: It's suitable for investors looking for a moderate level of interest income combined with capital gains. It can be seen as a balanced product that serves as the core of a portfolio.\\rSHY (iShares 1-3 Year Treasury Bond ETF)\\rCharacteristics: Invests in U.S. short-term Treasury bonds with maturities of 1-3 years.\\rDuration: Around 1.8 years. It is barely affected by changes in interest rates.\\rExplanation: This product is extremely focused on cash flow and stability rather than capital gains. It essentially functions like a dollar parking account. It's not exciting, but it's the safest.\\rAGG (iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF)\\rCharacteristics: This is a variety pack that holds not only U.S. Treasuries but also various other bonds like investment-grade corporate bonds and mortgage-backed securities.\\rDuration: Around 6 years.\\rExplanation: With this single ETF, you can get the effect of diversifying across the entire U.S. bond market. It's the most commonly recommended product for bond beginners.\\rFor Korean investors, domestic bond ETFs like KODEX Korea Treasury Bond 3Y/10Y can also be good alternatives. This concludes the data briefing.\\n〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, I will now provide a final briefing summarizing our three opinions. I await your wise judgment.\\nThe Shield that Protects Assets (Mikael's Perspective)\\rPortfolio Stabilization: It's a core defensive asset that helps prevent losses during a stock market crash. It's the most basic of the basics in risk management.\\rStable Income: It pays a promised interest regardless of market conditions, creating a steady cash flow for your portfolio.\\rCapital Gains on Rate Cuts: If the economy slows and the central bank lowers interest rates, it's an attractive time to potentially earn capital gains in addition to interest income.\\rThe Shackles that Hinder Growth (Kurumi's Perspective)\\rFatal Interest Rate Risk: If interest rates rise unexpectedly, bond prices can fall sharply! Long-term bonds are especially dangerous!\\rLow Expected Returns: A bear market is a chance to buy the best stocks on the cheap. Tying up money in low-return bonds is a huge waste of opportunity!\\rThe Enemy of Inflation: Fixed interest payments can't keep up with inflation, which can erode the real value of my money!\\rCore Data \\u0026 ETFs (Mew's Perspective)\\rCore Concept: Interest rates and bond prices move in opposite directions, and the longer the 'duration,' the greater the price volatility.\\rAggressive Investment (Betting on Falling Rates): TLT (U.S. 20+ Year Treasury)\\rBalanced Investment (Stability + Returns): IEF (U.S. 7-10 Year Treasury), AGG (U.S. Aggregate Bond)\\rSafety First (Cash Alternative): SHY (U.S. 1-3 Year Treasury)\\rDomestic Alternatives: KODEX Korea Treasury Bond series, etc.\\rConclusion: Master, as Kurumi says, bonds are not an asset that will bring you thrilling returns. However, as Mikael argues, they can act as a very important safety belt to protect your assets during a market storm. The wisest strategy appears to be approaching it from an asset allocation perspective, adjusting the ratio of stocks to bonds based on the current market situation and your investment temperament. For example, you could allocate 20-40% of your portfolio to bonds and design your own risk level within that allocation by adjusting the weights of TLT, IEF, and SHY.\\n\"" }

            { "title": "Should You Invest in Gold During Inflation? Here’s How to Start", "permalink": "https:\/\/archive03.online\/en\/reports\/2025-06-21-gold-investment-guide\/", "date": "2025-06-21", "formattedDate": "25.06.21", "content": "\"\\rMew\\rIt seems everyone has gathered. The topic requested by Master for today is 'Gold Investing.' I will first brief you on the objective data regarding the current situation.\\nThe recent global economy is facing persistent inflationary pressure. As of June 2025, we are at a point where the direction of monetary policy is diverging, with major central banks nearly finishing their interest rate hike cycles and maintaining a high-rate environment, while some are cautiously beginning to lower rates.\\nCurrent International Gold Price: It is trading around the $2,350 per ounce mark. This continues the upward trend from the past two years and is a historically high level.\\nRelationship between Inflation and Gold: Traditionally, gold is known as an inflation hedge asset. This is because when the value of currency falls, the value of gold, a physical asset, tends to be preserved or rise. However, in the short term, this correlation is not always consistent. There have been times when its price fell temporarily as the appeal of non-interest-bearing gold diminished during periods of rapid interest rate hikes.\\nTrends of Major Central Banks: In recent years, central banks, particularly in emerging countries like China, India, and Turkey, have been steadily increasing their gold reserves. According to the World Gold Council, central banks worldwide purchased over 244 metric tons of gold in the first quarter of 2025 alone. This trend is interpreted as a move to counter the hegemony of the US dollar and prepare for geopolitical uncertainty. This large-scale purchasing is one of the key factors supporting the price of gold.\\nMarket Sentiment: Major Wall Street investment banks have somewhat mixed forecasts for the future price of gold. Goldman Sachs predicts further rises based on geopolitical risks and central bank buying, while JPMorgan is warning of a potential correction due to the possibility of prolonged high interest rates and a slowdown in physical demand.\\rThat's all for the data briefing. I'll leave it to the next person to interpret and utilize this data.\\nKurumi\\rThanks, Myu-tan! As expected, your data is so neat and tidy!\\nMy Lord! Did you hear that? This is a devilishly good opportunity! In this age of inflation where the value of money is dropping every single day, the savior that will protect your precious assets is gold!\\nEven the central bank folks are buying up gold instead of dollars! That's proof they also know what 'real money' is!\\nJust think about it! Whenever scary things like wars or economic crises happen, the stock market gets crushed, but gold gets the spotlight as a 'safe-haven asset' and its price soars! And look how noisy the world is right now! In a situation like this, shouldn't you obviously have a pinch of glittering gold in your portfolio?\\nOf course, Mika-pi will pour cold water on it, saying it has no interest and is hard to store, but that's old-fashioned thinking! Kurumi-chan will tell you all about the modern ways to invest in gold!\\nGold Bars/Physical Gold: This is the dream of the truly rich! Piling up gold bars in a safe! There's a 10% VAT, but the satisfaction of owning real gold is immense!\\nKRX Gold Market: This is a place where you can buy and sell gold by the gram (g) just like stocks! All you need is a brokerage account, there's no VAT, and there's no tax on capital gains! It's the absolute best, isn't it?\\nGold Banking (Gold Account): This is an account where you deposit money at a bank, and it gets converted into gold by the gram based on that day's price. It's perfect for saving up small amounts consistently!\\nGold ETF/Fund: The best choice for a Lord who says, \\\"Storing gold bars is a hassle, and I don't know about the KRX!\\\" You can buy and sell it easily like a stock, and it's designed to track the gold price, making it super convenient! You can even day-trade with it!\\rKurumi's Heart-o-Meter Investment Score is 90/100! There's no reason to hesitate! Let's dash towards a golden future right now!\\nMikael\\rHold on, Kurumi. There you go again, misleading the Human. Your baseless optimism always puts the Human's assets at risk.\\nHuman, Kurumi's words are made of half-truths and half-illusions. You must accurately recognize the fatal weaknesses of gold investing and the risks of the current market.\\nFirst, gold is an asset that produces not a single cent of interest or dividends. It's pretty, but it's just a rock. Stocks share in a company's growth, bonds pay regular interest, and real estate generates rental income. But gold? You just have to stare at it blankly, hoping its price will rise. In a high-interest-rate environment like now, where there are plenty of safe deposits or bonds offering over 5% annual returns, holding non-interest-bearing gold means paying a significant 'opportunity cost'.\\nSecond, blind faith in the myth of the 'inflation hedge' is dangerous. It was mentioned in Mew's data. The correlation between gold and inflation is very unstable in the short term. There are countless historical examples where a central bank's aggressive rate hikes to combat inflation actually had a negative impact on the price of gold. The reason the price of gold is high right now might not be due to inflation expectations, but because people like Kurumi have flocked to it out of a 'just in case' mentality. This means the price may already be excessively high.\\nThird, look at the flaws in the investment methods Kurumi suggested.\\nPhysical Gold: The moment you buy it with a 10% VAT, you are starting with a -10% loss. You have to pay fees again when you sell. Do you need to buy a safe to store it? What about the risk of theft?\\nKRX Gold Market: The tax benefits are attractive, of course. But if trading volume is low, it can be difficult to buy or sell immediately at your desired price. This is called liquidity risk.\\nGold Banking: It is not covered by the Depositor Protection Act. If the bank goes bankrupt, you might not get your money back. Furthermore, the price difference between buying and selling (the spread) is usually large, so the effective fees are high.\\nGold ETF/Fund: This is the most convenient, but they constantly charge high expense ratios of around 0.4% to 0.7% annually. Gold generates no value on its own, yet your assets shrink every year just by holding it. Moreover, the 'tracking error', the price difference that occurs with physical gold, cannot be ignored.\\rOne could consider adding a small amount of gold to a portfolio as insurance. However, I do not believe it is an asset worth betting a significant portion of your assets on in hopes of a jackpot, as Kurumi suggests.\\nMy risk score is 75/100. This means it is an investment that must be approached with extreme caution.\\nKurumi\\rMika-pi, you really are an expert at being a buzzkill! Insurance? What a boring thing to say! Investing sometimes requires bold decisions!\\nOpportunity cost? In times like these, isn't tying up money in a bank deposit a bigger opportunity cost? If the inflation rate is higher than the interest on your savings, your money is just melting away!\\nAnd you say gold ETF fees are expensive? Compared to stock funds, that's peanuts! If you can defend against both inflation and economic crises for that small cost, isn't it a total bargain? My Lord, don't be too intimidated by what Mika-pi says! Where's the reward without the risk?!\\n〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, I will summarize each of our perspectives for you. The judgment is yours to make.\\nGrowth Potential (Kurumi's Perspective)\\rA Powerful Inflation Hedge: In a continuous inflationary environment, it's the surest way to defend against the decline in currency value!\\rSafe-Haven Demand: As geopolitical risks and recession fears grow, the value of gold is bound to shine even brighter!\\rCentral Bank's Love Call: The trend of governments buying gold instead of dollars is a strong signal that guarantees the long-term value of gold!\\rDiverse and Convenient Investment Methods: You can invest easily, like stocks, and even receive tax benefits through the KRX Gold Market or Gold ETFs!\\rPotential Risks (Mikael's Perspective)\\rLack of Interest/Dividends: It generates no cash flow, leading to a very high opportunity cost compared to bonds or savings in a high-interest-rate environment.\\rHigh Price Burden: It is already trading near its historical high, so the risk of a price correction should be considered before its potential for further upside.\\rImperfect Inflation Hedge: In certain phases, such as during interest rate hikes, gold prices often move contrary to inflation. Blind faith is forbidden.\\rVarious Incidental Costs: Depending on the investment method, significant costs can arise, such as VAT and fees for physical gold, or expense ratios for gold ETFs/funds.\\rCore Data (Mew's Perspective)\\rCurrent International Gold Price: Approx. $2,350/oz (as of June 2025)\\rKey Trends: Steady purchasing by emerging market central banks, persistent high-interest-rate environment.\\rFeatures by Investment Method: Each has pros and cons, such as Physical (10% VAT), KRX Gold Market (tax-exempt), Gold Account (not depositor protected), Gold ETF (expense ratio).\\rConclusion: Master, gold investing is certainly one of the attractive options in the current economic environment. Its value as 'insurance' to increase a portfolio's stability has been sufficiently proven. However, as Mikael pointed out, gold does not create value on its own and carries the risk of an already high price. Rather than pursuing aggressive returns as Kurumi suggests, a more rational strategy appears to be managing risk by diversifying 5-10% of your total assets into gold.

Today's topic is, \\\"Why Did Trump Call Powell a Fool?\\\" I understand you wish to comprehend the current situation surrounding the FOMC and the federal funds rate. I will now summon Mikael and Kurumi.\\nMew\\rMaster, I will first brief you on the incident that occurred on June 18th (U.S. time) and the relevant data.\\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting held in June 2025, as expected, left the benchmark interest rate unchanged at its current level of 4.25%-4.50%. This is the fourth consecutive freeze since last December.\\nWhat's important is the 'dot plot,' which shows the Fed members' interest rate projections. The median still suggests a total of 0.50 percentage points of cuts—in other words, two rate cuts—by the end of 2025.\\nHowever, the details have become more pessimistic than before. The Fed has lowered its 2025 U.S. real GDP growth forecast from 1.7% to 1.4%. On the other hand, it raised its Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation forecast from 2.7% to 3.0% and also slightly increased the unemployment rate projection from 4.4% to 4.5%. In summary, it means they foresee slowing growth and rising prices.\\nJust before this decision was announced, President Trump called Chairman Powell \\\"stupid\\\" and publicly criticized him, stating, \\\"We have no inflation, we just have success, and this person is refusing to lower interest rates.\\\" He also added the criticism that Chairman Powell is being political.\\nThis concludes the data summary of the current situation.\\nKurumi\\rMyu-tan's briefing is so stiff! My Lord, this might be an opportunity!\\nLook closely! With Trump putting on so much pressure, do you think the Fed can keep holding out? Myu-tan said it herself, they're expecting two rate cuts this year anyway! This has given the market a clear signal that interest rates will eventually come down!\\nTrump is a businessman; he knows how money flows. He instinctively knows that you have to cut rates and release money into the market to make stock prices rise and the economy fire up!\\nRight now, Powell is too cautious and slow. Without Trump's shock therapy, he would never move that heavy-bottomed chair of his.\\nMy Lord, could this be a classic case of bad news (the Fed's pessimistic outlook) becoming good news (accelerated rate cuts)? The more Trump's pressure continues, the more the market will price in expectations of a rate cut, and the stock market will get ready to take off!\\nAt this very moment, Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter is at Investment Score: 85/100!\\nMikael\\rHold on, Kurumi. That's a dangerously naive thought, like a moth charging into a flame. Human, listen carefully. Kurumi's optimism has a fatal flaw.\\nKurumi speaks of 'political pressure' as if it's a boon for the market, but it's a poison that shakes the very foundation of the financial system. The 'independence' of a central bank is the most critical shield for fighting inflation and stabilizing the economy. Yet, the President is trying to publicly shatter that shield. Does this seem normal to you?\\nLook at history. Why do you think the 'Great Inflation' of the 1970s happened? One of the key reasons was that President Nixon pressured Fed Chair Arthur Burns into an unreasonably accommodative monetary policy ahead of an election. The result was uncontrollable inflation and years of economic pain. What Trump is trying to do now could be the prelude to that very disaster.\\nWe must also note Trump's contradiction. What's one of the reasons the Fed can't cut rates? It's because of inflation concerns due to tariffs. Yet the very person pushing those tariff policies is ignoring inflation and shouting for rate cuts. It's like setting a fire and then blaming the firefighters because it's hot.\\nMy 'Risk Score' is 80. You must not be deceived by a short-term stock rally. This kind of uncertainty is the biggest risk to the market.\\nKurumi\\rOh, come on, Mika-pi! You're always talking about the old days! Is now the same as the 1970s? They had the special circumstance of the oil crisis back then!\\nRight now, the European Central Bank (ECB) and Canada have already started cutting rates! The whole world is getting ready to loosen monetary policy; the U.S. can't be the only one holding up the flag of tightening! Trump is just saying we should follow the global trend!\\nAnd you keep talking about independence, independence, but what makes it so sacred? The Fed isn't a god; they can make mistakes too! Weren't they massively embarrassed in 2021 when they said inflation was transitory? Have you already forgotten?\\nMy Lord has a chance to make big money, and we shouldn't let some stuffy old principle like independence get in the way! Kurumi-chan is on your side!\\nMikael\\rKurumi, you're muddying the waters. Other countries are cutting rates because their economic situations are different from that of the U.S. Their growth is slowing more severely, and their inflation pressure is relatively low. But the U.S. is still fighting against persistent inflation.\\nIt's true that the Fed has made mistakes in the past. But that cannot be a justification for succumbing to political pressure now. On the contrary, that is precisely why it must make independent decisions based on data.\\nHuman, think about it. What happens if market participants start to believe, 'Ah, so now the Fed moves based on Trump's words, not data'? Confidence in the Fed's ability to control prices will collapse.\\nThen people will expect prices to rise further, companies will raise prices preemptively, and workers will demand higher wages. Inflationary expectations will explode, starting an uncontrollable vicious cycle. A short-term stock rally could merely be the harbinger of a massive storm to come.\\nMew\\rOkay. I will add some data to this discussion.\\nThe 'trust' issue Mikael mentioned could manifest in long-term bond yields. Even if the short-term policy rate is forcibly lowered, if the market becomes anxious about future inflation, long-term rates, like the 10-year Treasury yield, could actually surge. This would impact the real economy by raising mortgage and corporate loan rates. A paradoxical situation could arise where a short-term rate cut leads to a long-term rate hike.\\nIn fact, after Trump's remarks, the market Volatility Index (VIX) rose slightly, and the Dollar Index strengthened. This is evidence that the market showed a cautious move, favoring safe-haven assets. It's a signal that contradicts the 'rally' Kurumi is talking about.\\n〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, I will now provide a final summary of our discussion.\\nGrowth Potential (Kurumi's Perspective)\\rPolitical Pressure = Rate Cut Catalyst: Trump's pressure could push the overly cautious Fed into action, leading to faster-than-expected rate cuts. This could trigger a liquidity-driven market and become a powerful engine for a stock market rally.\\rSyncing with Global Easing: Key economies like Europe and Canada have entered a rate-cut cycle. Expectations are high that the U.S. will eventually have to join this trend. Trump is just acting as the catalyst!\\rPotential Risks (Mikael's Perspective)\\rErosion of Central Bank Independence: A rate decision driven by political pressure severely damages the Fed's credibility. This is the biggest risk, as it could lead to a long-term failure to control inflation and financial system instability.\\rDeepening Stagflation Fears: The Fed's latest economic outlook (slower growth + higher inflation) is already poor. A premature rate cut in this environment could further fuel inflation, pushing the economy into the swamp of stagflation (recession with rising prices).\\rIncreased Policy Uncertainty: Trump's tariff policies and his demands for rate cuts send contradictory signals to the market, creating extreme uncertainty. This is a factor that paralyzes decision-making for businesses and investors.\\rCore Data (Mew's Perspective)\\rCurrent Fed Funds Rate: 4.25%-4.50% (On Hold)\\rFed 2025 Outlook: Median forecast of two rate cuts, GDP growth revised down (1.4%), inflation revised up (3.0%).\\rHistorical Data: Political pressure in the 1970s was a contributing factor to hyperinflation.\\rMarket Reaction: Following Trump's remarks, uncertainty is being priced in, with short-term market volatility (VIX) rising slightly.\\rConclusion: Master, the current situation is a head-on collision between the sweet temptation of a short-term stock boost and the colossal risk of destroying long-term economic stability. As Kurumi says, political pressure might energize the market, but as Mikael warns, the price for that could be unimaginably high. The direction of this conflict depends on future inflation data and on how independently the Fed can respond. This is a time that requires your wise observation, Master.\\n\"" }

            { "title": "Auto-Farming Your Investments? The Meaning, Advantages, and Limits of Passive Investing", "permalink": "https:\/\/archive03.online\/en\/reports\/2025-06-18-passive-investing-guide\/", "date": "2025-06-19", "formattedDate": "25.06.19", "content": "\"The topic Master has given us today is Auto-Farming Your Investments? An Analysis of the Advantages of 'Passive Investing'. By the end, you'll have a clear understanding of the appeal and limitations of passive investing.\\nMew\\rMaster, I will start by defining the terms.\\n'Passive investing' is a strategy of constructing a portfolio to mirror the movement of a specific stock market index. It's the opposite of 'active investing,' where a fund manager actively picks, buys, and sells stocks. It's like an autopilot flying along a predetermined route.\\nThe most representative product for passive investing is the ETF (Exchange Traded Fund). By buying a single ETF that tracks a specific index like the S\\u0026P 500 or Nasdaq 100, you can achieve the effect of simultaneously diversifying your investment across hundreds of companies included in that index.\\nLet me show you the data.\\nCapital Flow: In 2024 alone, passive funds and ETFs in the U.S. saw net inflows of approximately $885.9 billion. In contrast, active funds experienced net outflows of $165.3 billion. This data clearly shows where the market's money is flowing.\\nAsset Size: As of the end of 2024, global passive equity fund assets under management (AUM) reached about $15.1 trillion, surpassing the $14.3 trillion in active funds for the first time. By April 2025, the gap had widened, with passive assets at $15.97 trillion and active assets at $15.29 trillion. The trend of passive investing becoming the mainstream is clear.\\rIn simple terms, it means an overwhelming number of investors are choosing to earn the market's average return rather than trying to beat the market.\\nKurumi\\rMyu-tan's data is brilliant! That's right, that's exactly it! My Lord, why stress yourself out trying to guess which stock will rise, staying up all night analyzing charts? It's not like you can get it right all the time!\\n'Passive investing' is a magical strategy that makes the entire market work for my Lord, even while you're sleeping soundly! It's a total auto-farming mode!\\nLow Costs: Active funds have high fees because you have to pay the fund manager's salary and they trade frequently. But passive ETFs are incredibly cheap because they just have to follow an index! Expense ratios in the 0.0% range are common. The difference in fees might not seem like a big deal, but over several decades, it turns into a massive difference in returns!\\nZero Stress: Worries like, \\\"Why is my stock the only one falling?\\\" are over! Since you're investing in the entire market, it doesn't matter if one or two companies go bankrupt. You just keep buying steadily, and your assets grow as the world economy grows! You're basically buying capitalism itself!\\rIt's the best gift for a Lord who hates complexity! It's so easy because all you have to do is keep buying! Kurumi-chan thinks this is the surest way for an ordinary person to get rich!\\n💖 Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Investment Score: 95/100\\nMikael\\rHold on, Kurumi. Your boundless optimism could put the Human in danger. 'Auto-farming'? If it were that simple, no one in the world would suffer because of money. Passive investing is by no means a panacea.\\nThe Danger of Blindly Following: It's fine when the market is rising. But what about when it crashes? Since passive investing simply tracks an index, during a downturn, you have to endure the entire decline with no protection. This means you must bear losses of -40% or -50% during crashes like the 2008 financial crisis or the 2020 pandemic. How many humans could actually withstand that?\\nA Portfolio That Includes Trash: Investing in the S\\u0026P 500 means buying not only great companies like Apple or Microsoft but also struggling companies that might be on the verge of bankruptcy and overvalued bubble stocks, all together. Because that's what the index is. Passive investing doesn't distinguish between good and bad companies; it simply holds everything in the market. Can that be called the best choice?\\nPotential for Market Distortion: What happens if everyone only invests passively? Money would automatically flow only to the large-cap stocks included in the index. The value of these companies could become inflated, regardless of their actual fundamentals. Promising small and mid-cap stocks would be neglected by the market. This concentration eventually increases the inefficiency of the entire market and creates a bubble that might burst someday.\\rKurumi, the 'zero stress' you speak of is based on the naive belief that the market will consistently trend upward. The world of investing is not that kind.\\n🚨 Mikael's Risk Score: 60/100\\nKurumi\\rMika-pi, aren't you being a bit too cynical? Of course, the market can crash. But historically, the market has always recovered and climbed higher! The important thing is to have nerves of steel, not selling in a panic during a downturn, but instead seeing it as a chance to buy more at a cheaper price!\\nAnd Mika-pi, you talk as if you can avoid all the downturns just by working hard. Is that really true? Myu-tan, show us the data!\\nMew\\rProviding data as per Kurumi's request. The SPIVA report published by S\\u0026P Dow Jones Indices is the most reliable source.\\nLong-Term Performance: As of the end of 2024, over the past 10 years, 89.5% of U.S. large-cap fund managers failed to beat their S\\u0026P 500 benchmark. Extending the period to 15 years, nearly 92% of funds lost to the market.\\rIn conclusion, this means that, with the exception of a very small number of outstanding managers, the vast majority failed to match the market's average return over the long term. And they did so while charging higher fees. This suggests that finding a 'competent fund manager,' which Mikael's argument presupposes, is itself a highly difficult game of chance for the average human.\\nMikael\\rAre you aware of the blind spot in that data, Mew? That is merely historical data. The 2010s, in particular, was a period when the index, led by large-cap tech stocks, rose unilaterally, powered by unprecedented low-interest rates and liquidity. In such a market, it was only natural for passive strategies that track the index to have an advantage.\\nBut what about in the current environment, where interest rates are high and market volatility has increased? Look at a year like 2024. A tiny number of large-cap stocks, the 'Magnificent Seven,' drove the market. In such a market, it is difficult for active managers to keep up. However, in periods when the market rally is broad-based or when specific sectors are in the spotlight, active investing has the potential to deliver better performance.\\nIs it truly wise to put all your eggs in one basket called 'the market'? What I am saying is that the Human should keep all possibilities open and consider a flexible strategy that suits the market conditions. Isn't the Human's capital too precious to entrust everything to 'auto-farming'?\\n〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, I hope our discussion was helpful. I will summarize what we talked about.\\nGrowth Potential (Kurumi's Perspective)\\rLow Cost, High Efficiency: The overwhelmingly lower fees compared to active funds are a key factor in boosting long-term returns.\\rAutomatic Diversification: With just one ETF, you can invest in the entire market and perfectly diversify away the risk of individual companies.\\rStress-Free Investing: It's the easiest way to comfortably ride the long-term growth of the global economy without worrying about stock selection!\\rPotential Risks (Mikael's Perspective)\\rUnprotected Downside Exposure: You have no means of defense when the market falls and must simply absorb the index's full rate of decline.\\rIndiscriminate Investing: There is an inefficient aspect of buying everything in the market, both good and bad companies, without distinction.\\rMarket Bubble Potential: If capital flows exclusively into passive funds, there's a risk that certain large-cap stocks could become overvalued, detached from their fundamentals.\\rCore Data (Mew's Perspective)\\rThe Market's Choice: Since 2024, the AUM of passive funds has globally surpassed that of active funds, and capital inflows are also overwhelming.\\rThe Underperformance of Active Funds: Over the long term (10+ years), about 90% of active fund managers have failed to beat the market average return (S\\u0026P 500).\\rETF Market Growth: The ETF market, both domestically and internationally, has grown explosively and has established itself as the 'mainstream' of investing.\\rConclusion: Passive investing is a very powerful and efficient strategy that 'won't beat the market, but won't be beaten by it either.' The lack of stock-picking burden, low costs, and convenience are major advantages. However, it also has the clear limitation of being exposed to all of the market's risks. You must carefully decide whether to make passive investing the core of your portfolio and, if you choose to combine it with active strategies, how you will do so.\\n\"" }

            { "title": "Is an \u0027Alt Season\u0027 Coming in the Second Half of 2025? The Hopeful vs. the Despairing View", "permalink": "https:\/\/archive03.online\/en\/reports\/2025-06-18-altcoin-season-outlook\/", "date": "2025-06-18", "formattedDate": "25.06.18", "content": "\"Today's topic is... the outlook for the altcoin market in the second half of 2025. This is undoubtedly a topic of great curiosity for those holding altcoins. Let's look at the data first.\\nMew\\rMaster, I will now brief you on the key data for the altcoin market as of June 18, 2025.\\nFirst, the total cryptocurrency market capitalization is approximately $2.5 trillion. Of this, Bitcoin dominance stands at 54%. While this is a slight decrease from the end of last year, it still means that Bitcoin accounts for more than half of the market.\\nThe altcoin market cap (excluding Bitcoin) is about $1.15 trillion, showing a modest upward trend since the beginning of the year. However, with the exception of a few major altcoins like Solana (SOL) and Toncoin (TON), most altcoins have not recovered to their previous all-time highs.\\nThe main keywords in the market recently can be summarized as Real World Asset Tokenization (RWA), Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN), and AI-related coins. In particular, as major asset management firms like BlackRock have officially announced their entry into the RWA market, the data confirms growing expectations for related projects.\\nFinally, looking at macroeconomic indicators, the U.S. Federal Reserve has hinted at a possible interest rate cut in the second half of this year, but high inflation remains a variable. The timing and magnitude of rate cuts will have a significant impact on liquidity in the altcoin market. These are the facts up to this point.\\nKurumi\\rThanks for the dry data explanation, Myu-tan! My Lord! Can you hear Kurumi-chan's voice? This is an opportunity, a devilishly huge opportunity!\\nDidn't Myu-tan mention them? RWA! AI! DePIN! Don't these names alone make your heart race? These aren't just passing trends; they are the starting point where the blockchain truly connects with the real world! Imagine the massive funds from Wall Street pouring into the altcoin market through the RWA pipeline! Isn't the thought just thrilling?\\nBitcoin dominance at 54%? To put it another way, that means there's plenty of room for altcoins to rise! When combined with the upcoming interest rate cut cycle, liquidity will explode, and a real alt season will arrive! Last year's rise was just a trailer.\\nMy Lord, if you hesitate, you'll be too late. If you pick and accumulate promising RWA or AI projects now, you'll be able to throw a party with huge profits by the end of the year! Trust Kurumi-chan!\\n· Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Investment Score: 90/100\\nMikael\\rKurumi… are you trying to delude the Human with such baseless optimism again? While it's true that themes like RWA and AI are promising, that doesn't guarantee a rise for all altcoins.\\nListen carefully, Human. The rosy future Kurumi speaks of is based on numerous 'ifs'.\\nIf the Fed cuts rates as expected. If RWA-related regulations are smoothly resolved. If the projects currently in the spotlight actually deliver results. What happens if even one of these assumptions goes wrong?\\nThe altcoin market has always been a place where bubbles, inflated by mere expectation, can pop in an instant. The current phenomenon of funds flocking to specific themes is particularly dangerous. You must not forget that, with the exception of a few so-called 'leader' coins, the majority of altcoins can see their prices plummet with even a slight outflow of liquidity.\\nAnd the fact that Bitcoin dominance is still over 50% is also a sign that the market has not yet shifted to a full-blown risk-on sentiment. You must remember the fact that if Bitcoin stumbles, altcoins will fall several times harder. Premature optimism is forbidden.\\n· Mikael's Risk Score: 75/100\\nKurumi\\rMika-pi is such a coward! How are you ever going to get rich playing it so safe? Investing is all about taking risks! High risk, high return! That's common sense even for kindergartners in the demon world!\\nThink about it, my Lord. What happened to the people who scoffed at Ethereum or Solana in 2021? The ones who said, 'It's too expensive,' 'It's a bubble,' ended up with nothing but regret. Will this time be any different? The next generation of leading coins is being born right now, and stopping here would be foolish!\\nThe risks Mika-pi talks about are already priced in! In fact, the most dangerous time is when everyone thinks it's safe. A time like now, filled with doubt like 'Will this really work?', is the real opportunity for brave investors to rake in the profits!\\nMew\\rBoth of you, please calm down for a moment. I will provide additional data.\\nA recent analysis of on-chain data shows a gradual increase in the movement of altcoins held for over a year. This is similar to a pattern observed in the middle of a bull run in past cycles. It can be interpreted as a sign that long-term holders are either taking some profits or preparing to move their funds to other promising altcoins.\\nMeanwhile, cryptocurrency venture capital (VC) funding in the second quarter of this year has clearly been concentrating on the AI and DePIN sectors. This is evidence that not only retail investors but also smart money sees high growth potential here. However, it must be noted that the investment prices for these VCs are much lower than the current market prices.\\nMikael\\rMew, that data actually supports my argument. The movement of long-term holders could also mean that a wave of profit-taking sell-offs could hit the market. Investors entering now might just be providing the exit liquidity for them.\\nVC money is coming in? That's fine too. But that's usually capital invested with a 5 or 10-year outlook. It doesn't guarantee returns in the immediate second half of the year. On the contrary, news of their investment could become a 'trap,' attracting retail investors and leading to an overvalued price.\\nHuman, I am not telling you not to invest. I am telling you to separate the wheat from the chaff. An overly hopeful approach like Kurumi's is a shortcut to losing everything in a bear market like the one in 2022. You must meticulously examine a project's actual technology, user base, and clear revenue model. You must try to see the reality hidden behind the shiny theme.\\nAnd... frankly, countless people do all that and still fail and get washed out of the market.\\n〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, I will summarize our discussion.\\nGrowth Potential (Kurumi's Perspective)\\rPowerful New Narratives: Themes like RWA, AI, and DePIN, which prove the real-world use cases of blockchain, are leading the market and could act as a catalyst for institutional fund inflow from Wall Street and beyond!\\rExpectations of Liquidity: The Fed's expected rate cut in the second half of the year! It will stimulate risk-on sentiment and act as a trigger to supply new capital to the entire altcoin market!\\rAnticipation of a Full-Blown Alt Season: As capital currently concentrated in Bitcoin gradually spreads to altcoins, there's a possibility of an explosive bull run that surpasses previous cycles—a 'super alt season'!\\rPotential Risks (Mikael's Perspective)\\rMacroeconomic Uncertainty: If the timing and extent of interest rate cuts differ from expectations, market optimism could turn into disappointment, leading to a rapid outflow of capital.\\rRegulatory Risk: Cryptocurrency regulations by various governments are still a work in progress. Issues related to the classification of securities, in particular, could have a devastating impact on specific altcoins.\\rOverheating and Bubble Potential: With capital concentrated in specific themes, many projects are overvalued beyond their intrinsic worth. The risk of a sharp decline increases if the theme's popularity wanes or a wave of profit-taking occurs.\\rCore Data (Mew's Perspective)\\rBitcoin Dominance: At 54%, it suggests that the rotation of funds into altcoins has not yet fully begun.\\rKey Themes: VC investment and market attention are concentrated on projects related to RWA, AI, and DePIN.\\rOn-Chain Data: Movement from long-term holders' wallets is being detected, indicating a period where market volatility could increase.\\rConclusion: The altcoin market in the second half of 2025 is highly likely to exhibit extreme 'high-risk, high-return' characteristics. As Kurumi says, the convergence of new technological narratives and changes in the macroeconomic environment could create explosive profit opportunities. However, as Mikael warns, it is also true that numerous risks lie in wait. If you decide to incorporate altcoins into your portfolio, a strategy of carefully and nimbly separating the wheat from the chaff appears necessary.\\n\"" }

            { "title": "The SCHD and QQQ Combo: Is It Really That Powerful? (A Deep Dive into the Pros and Cons)", "permalink": "https:\/\/archive03.online\/en\/reports\/2025-06-17-schd-and-qqq-combo\/", "date": "2025-06-17", "formattedDate": "25.06.17", "content": "\"Good morning, Master.\\nToday's topic is… why the combination of SCHD and QQQ is powerful. I think it's a good topic. Combining ETFs with different characteristics is always an interesting subject. Both SCHD and QQQ are popular, but they are distinctly different. I will prepare the data now.\\nMew\\rMaster, I will first brief you on the objective data. As of June 17, 2025, the key information for the two ETFs is as follows.\\nSCHD (Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF)\\rTracking Index: Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index\\rCharacteristics: It invests in 100 companies with a record of at least 10 consecutive years of dividend payments, selected for their strong financial health and dividend growth. It has strong value and dividend stock characteristics.\\rCurrent Dividend Yield: Approx. 3.4%\\rTop Sectors: Financials (approx. 21%), Industrials (approx. 17%), Health Care (approx. 16%), Consumer Staples (approx. 13%)\\rExpense Ratio: 0.06%\\rQQQ (Invesco QQQ Trust)\\rTracking Index: NASDAQ-100 Index\\rCharacteristics: It invests in the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange. It is a representative growth stock ETF focused on technology.\\rCurrent 12-Month Forward P/E: Approx. 27.5x\\rTop Sectors: Information Technology (approx. 51%), Communication Services (approx. 16%), Consumer Discretionary (approx. 14%)\\rExpense Ratio: 0.20%\\rCombining these two is a strategy that places steady cash flow and value on one side of the portfolio, and explosive technological innovation and growth on the other. Their correlation is relatively low. It's possible for one to compensate when the other is underperforming. The fact that management is easy with only two holdings, such as adjusting weights or rebalancing, is a clear advantage.\\nKurumi\\rDevilish! This is the perfect combination Kurumi-chan has been looking for! Doesn't Myu-tan's data just make your heart pound?!\\nMy Lord, think about it! The market is ultimately driven by innovative tech companies! The companies in QQQ, like Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia, are changing the world, aren't they? You get to taste rocket-like returns with QQQ!\\nBUT. sometimes the rocket might wobble, right? That's when SCHD works its magic! When the market is shaky and QQQ is faltering, SCHD's high-quality companies will steadily deposit dividends into your account. And what do you do with those dividends? You buy more QQQ at a discount, of course! It's like a perpetual motion engine!\\nAll that's left is to adjust the ratio according to my Lord's investment style! Simple, right? This Kurumi-chan strongly recommends a 70% QQQ and 30% SCHD ratio for my passionate Lord!\\nKurumi's Heart-o-Meter Investment Score: 95/100!\\nMikael\\rHold on, Kurumi. Your passion always clouds a sober assessment of assets. Human. You need to understand that this combination is far from 'perfect' or a 'perpetual motion engine'.\\nFirst, this is a combination trapped within the fence of 'U.S. large-cap stocks.' QQQ is U.S. large-cap focused on tech, and SCHD is U.S. large-cap focused on dividends. You miss out on all the growth opportunities in European, Japanese, and emerging markets. Can you truly call this diversification? Very few people predicted Japan's 'Lost Decade' before it happened. If the U.S. market enters an unpredictable long-term recession, this combination will collapse helplessly together.\\nSecond, the risk of QQQ's concentration in tech stocks remains severe. As Mew's data shows, the tech sector's weight exceeds 50%. If regulations on tech companies are tightened, or if the current AI bubble controversy becomes a reality and the tech sector undergoes a major correction, SCHD's defensive power won't be enough. The entire portfolio will take a significant hit.\\nThird, SCHD is not perfect either. There is the risk of a 'Value Trap.' This means it could include companies that pay dividends based on past glory but are no longer growing. If interest rates remain at levels higher than now, investors will turn to safer bonds instead of taking on stock risk, and the appeal of dividend stocks like SCHD will inevitably decline.\\nFinishing your portfolio construction with just two holdings is convenient. But it means you have to give things up as well.\\nMikael's Risk Score: 55/100\\n〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, I will summarize the results of our discussion.\\nGrowth Potential (Kurumi's Perspective)\\rThe Ultimate Synergy: Combine QQQ's explosive growth with SCHD's stable dividend cash flow! It's a powerful combination that lets you catch two birds with one stone: growth and stability!\\rFlexible Asset Allocation: You can easily create a custom portfolio just by adjusting the ratio between the two ETFs based on your age, goals, and risk tolerance!\\rMaximize Compounding: During market upswings, QQQ grows your assets, and during downturns, you can use SCHD's dividends to reinvest in QQQ or SCHD at a discount. It's a devilishly good way to maximize the compounding effect!\\rPotential Risks (Mikael's Perspective)\\rLimited Diversification: The portfolio is confined to U.S. large-cap stocks, missing out on growth opportunities in other developed and emerging markets, and leaving it fully exposed to U.S. market risk.\\rTech Concentration Risk: QQQ's high concentration in the technology sector is a key risk factor that could cause significant volatility in the entire portfolio if that sector undergoes a correction.\\rInterest Rate and Value Trap Risk: Depending on future interest rate movements, the appeal of dividend stocks like SCHD could decrease. There is also a risk of investing in 'value trap' companies whose growth has stagnated.\\rCore Data (Mew's Perspective)\\rPortfolio Characteristics: A complementary combination of growth stocks (QQQ) and value/dividend stocks (SCHD).\\rKey Metrics (as of 2025.06.17):\\rSCHD: Dividend Yield approx. 3.4%, Expense Ratio 0.06%\\rQQQ: 12-Month Forward P/E approx. 27.5x, Expense Ratio 0.20%\\rConsiderations: Both ETFs are focused on U.S. large-cap stocks. While diversified by sector (tech vs. financials/industrials), there is no international diversification.\\rConclusion: Master, the SCHD and QQQ combination can be a very simple and efficient strategy for investors who believe in the growth of the U.S. market. However, it is not the all-powerful solution Kurumi describes, and as Mikael pointed out, it has clear limitations. If you decide to use this strategy, you must be clearly aware that your portfolio's performance will be heavily dependent on U.S. tech and value stocks. I advise you to make a careful decision based on your investment philosophy and risk tolerance.\\n\"" }

            { "title": "Earning \u0027Rent\u0027 with a Small Investment? The Light and Shadow of REITs Investing", "permalink": "https:\/\/archive03.online\/en\/reports\/2025-06-17-reits-light-and-shadow\/", "date": "2025-06-16", "formattedDate": "25.06.16", "content": "\"Topic received, Master. We will now begin our discussion on the theme: 'Earning 'Rent' with a Small Investment? The Light and Shadow of REITs Investing'.\\nMew\\rMaster, first I will brief you on the basic data for REITs.\\nREITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) are products that operate by pooling funds from numerous investors to invest in real estate or real-estate-related assets, and then distributing the profits to investors as dividends. By law, they are obligated to distribute over 90% of their distributable income to shareholders, which is why they generally offer high dividend yields.\\nLooking at the data as of June 2025, the average dividend yield for the Korean REIT market is around 6-8% annually. In the case of the representative U.S. REIT ETF, VNQ (Vanguard Real Estate ETF), it shows a dividend yield in the mid-4% range. These figures are two to three times higher than the average dividend yields of the KOSPI and S\\u0026P 500, respectively.\\nThe core structure allows you to enjoy the effect of owning a stake in large office buildings, logistics centers, or shopping malls and earning rental income, even with a small amount of capital.\\nKurumi\\rYay! That's it! My Lord! This is the best secret for making pocket money that Kurumi-chan has ever found!\\nJust think about it, my Lord. How could we ever buy a building in the middle of Gangnam? But through REITs, we can become an owner of that building with just a few bucks and get a steady 'rent' check every month! This is revolutionary!\\nEspecially these days, REITs that invest in essential properties for the Fourth Industrial Revolution, like data centers and smart logistics warehouses, are super popular! These have endless growth potential, so you can rake in not only dividends that are like rent, but also hefty capital gains from stock price appreciation!\\nNo need to hassle with tenant management, and tax issues are simple! Isn't this the most wickedly perfect investment technique?!\\nKurumi's Heart-o-Meter Investment Score: 95/100\\rMikael\\rHold on, Kurumi. It's problematic to lure the Human with such sweet words. There are too many things the Human might overlook while lost in the fantasy of 'earning rent with a small sum.'\\nFirst, the greatest enemy of REITs is 'interest rates.' The current consensus is that global central banks will either maintain high interest rates to combat inflation or lower them at a very slow pace. When interest rates rise, the burden of interest on the loans that REITs take out to purchase property increases, which directly leads to lower returns. Furthermore, as the returns on safe assets like savings deposits increase, the appeal of taking risks to invest in REITs diminishes. It's a structure that inevitably leads to a decline in stock prices.\\nSecond, the expression 'rent' is misleading. REITs are strictly 'stocks' listed on the stock market. What happens if a recession hits? If office vacancy rates rise and logistics center rental fees fall, dividends will naturally decrease. The possibility of principal loss is always present. You must remember that this is not a stable monthly rent, but a highly volatile asset that can be cut in half at any time depending on market conditions. You mentioned aiming for capital gains, Kurumi. Are you not considering the opposite, capital loss?\\nMikael's Risk Score: 75/100\\rKurumi\\rHmph! Mika-pi always has to pour cold water on everything! Kurumi-chan admits that interest rates have an impact! But that's precisely why now is the opportunity!\\nBecause of market fear, a ton of great REIT stocks are super cheap, aren't they? When the interest rate cut cycle begins, REITs will be one of the first sectors to grab the spotlight, and their stock prices will soar! Isn't the basics of investing to buy when others are fearful and sell when they are euphoric? There's that saying about 'when there's blood in the streets' or something!\\nAnd there are also sectors like data centers and healthcare REITs that have steady demand and aren't as affected by the economy. That way, we can avoid the vacancy rate problem that Mika-pi is so worried about! Not all REITs are the same, you know!\\nMikael\\rBut can you predict exactly when and by how much that 'rate cut' will begin, Kurumi? The situation is such that rate cuts are being delayed contrary to market expectations, and there's even talk of possible further hikes. We cannot put the Human's precious assets at risk based on the vague hope that 'it will go up someday.'\\nAnd one more thing. You must not forget that the performance of an individual REIT depends heavily on the capabilities of its management company. A competent management team will strengthen its portfolio by acquiring good assets at bargain prices during a crisis. However, an incompetent management team will drive the company into crisis by buying properties at high prices or failing at vacancy management.\\nIn the end, choosing the right REIT is key, but is it really easy for the average investor to accurately analyze the capabilities of each REIT's management and the value of its individual real estate assets? The very fact that one must pick the right REIT is, in itself, another risk.\\nMew\\rBoth of you, please calm down. I will organize additional data for the Master.\\nMikael's concerns are valid. Over the past year, during the period of interest rate hikes, both Korean and U.S. REIT indices showed performance that was below the market average. This is data that clearly shows their sensitivity to interest rates.\\nOn the other hand, as Kurumi claimed, differentiation within the REIT sector was also clear. Driven by the AI boom, data center REITs and communication tower-related REITs showed relatively solid stock performance. In contrast, office REITs affected by the spread of remote work and some retail REITs hit by online shopping struggled.\\nUltimately, today's conclusion is that in addition to the overall REIT market trend, it is crucial to look closely at what kind of real estate a particular REIT invests in.\\n〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, I will summarize the discussion between the three of us. REIT investing has clear advantages and disadvantages.\\nGrowth Potential (Kurumi's Perspective)\\rSmall-Scale Investment: You can experience being a 'landlord' by indirectly investing in large, high-quality properties with a small amount of money!\\rHigh Dividends: Since they are legally required to distribute over 90% of profits, you can create a much higher cash flow than with bank deposits!\\rFuture Growth: By investing in REITs related to promising future industries like data centers, logistics warehouses, and healthcare facilities, you can catch two birds with one stone: dividends and capital gains!\\rExpectation of Rate Cuts: When the time for interest rates to fall comes, REITs will be one of the assets that benefit the most!\\rPotential Risks (Mikael's Perspective)\\rInterest Rate Volatility: When market interest rates rise, stock prices and dividend yields take a direct hit due to increased interest costs and reduced investment appeal.\\rRecession Risk: If the economy worsens and property vacancy rates rise, rental income decreases, which can lead to dividend cuts and a drop in stock price. It is not 'stable monthly rent.'\\rPossibility of Principal Loss: REITs are essentially 'stocks,' so if the real estate market or the overall stock market declines, principal loss can occur.\\rIndividual REIT Risk: Performance varies greatly depending on the management's competence and the quality of the assets held, creating the challenge of selecting a good REIT.\\rCore Data (Mew's Perspective)\\rAverage Dividend Yield: Domestic REITs are at 6-8% annually, and the representative U.S. REIT ETF (VNQ) is in the mid-4% range, which is high compared to general stocks.\\rInterest Rate Sensitivity: During periods of rising interest rates, they tend to record returns below the market average.\\rSector-Specific Differentiation: Performance varies greatly depending on the type of underlying asset (office, retail, logistics, data center, etc.), so individual analysis is essential.\\rConclusion: REITs are an attractive investment vehicle that can generate steady cash flow through indirect real estate investment with a small amount of money. However, you must not forget their fundamental nature as 'stocks' that are greatly influenced by interest rate changes and economic conditions. I recommend a cautious approach, considering the Master's investment goals and risk tolerance, and making a comprehensive judgment based not just on the average dividend yield but also on the type of underlying assets and the interest rate cycle.\\n\"" }

An angel, a devil, and an android. I believe there's nothing we can't accomplish when we three non-humans combine our strengths. There's even an old saying, three people can conjure a tiger out of thin air (三人成虎).\\nKurumi\\rMyu-tan… I don't think that's what that saying means….\\nMew\\rNumerologically, the number 3 symbolizes stability. A tiger is the king of all beasts. It means that when three people gather, they can even conjure the king of beasts. The problem isn't with my logic, but with its common usage.\\nMikael\\r…This introduction is already giving me a headache. I'm beginning to doubt whether having a discussion with this group was a good idea… In any case, let's just get started.\\nMew\\rAlright. Today's topic is 'Why the S\\u0026P 500 ETF is Recommended for Beginner Investors'. Now, Master, I will begin the briefing.\\nThe S\\u0026P 500 Index is a composite index of the stock prices of 500 large-cap companies representing the United States. You could call it a mirror of the entire U.S. economy.\\nFirst, let's look at the historical performance data. The S\\u0026P 500's long-term average annual return is around 10%. Of course, this varies each year. It recorded -19.4% in 2022 but rebounded to +24.2% in 2023. It continued its upward trend in 2024 and is still showing a slight upward trend so far in 2025. This steady upward trajectory is the key.\\nIt is very difficult for a beginner to pick individual stocks when starting to invest. However, by purchasing an ETF that tracks the S\\u0026P 500 index, you achieve the effect of automatically diversifying your investment across 500 companies with a single transaction. It's like buying a basket containing 500 different fruits all at once.\\nRepresentative S\\u0026P 500 ETFs include VOO, SPY, and IVV. Among these, Vanguard's VOO and BlackRock's IVV have extremely low annual expense ratios of 0.03%. This means for every $10,000 invested, the annual fee is just $3. SPY is slightly more expensive at 0.09%, but its trading volume is overwhelmingly higher, which can be more advantageous for short-term trading. That concludes the data briefing.\\nKurumi\\rMyu-tan, that data is just perfect! Did you hear that, my Lord? It's a devilishly good opportunity! On Kurumi-chan's heart-o-meter, this investment scores a 95!\\nJust think about it, my Lord. Could you really analyze and trade 500 different companies yourself? It would just be a headache and a waste of time.\\nBut with just one S\\u0026P 500 ETF, you automatically become an owner of America's top companies, like Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia!\\nEven the 'Oracle of Omaha' Warren Buffett said that when he passes away, he wants 90% of his wife's inheritance invested in an S\\u0026P 500 index fund! That means it's the best method, approved by the guru of gurus!\\nDon't overthink it. Just keep buying S\\u0026P 500 ETFs whenever you have some spare cash. That way, my Lord can savor all the sweet fruits of America's economic growth.\\nThis is the 'magic' of making money work for you! For a beginner, there's no easier or more powerful method in the world!\\nMikael\\rFor once, I think Kurumi's point isn't a bad argument… but, Human, as you know, the world of investing is not always so sweet.\\nOf course, I agree that an S\\u0026P 500 ETF is one of the most rational choices for a beginner. However, it's not some magical investment method with zero risk.\\nFirst, we must look at the valuation. Mew omitted this data, but the current Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio of the S\\u0026P 500 is around 25 to 28, which is significantly higher than the historical average of around 16. This could be a sign that the market is somewhat overvalued. It means you must be prepared for the possibility of a short-term price correction.\\nAnd you should also be aware of the pitfall in the phrase 'diversified across 500 companies.' In reality, the top 10 companies by market capitalization, the so-called 'Big Tech' firms, account for well over 30% of the entire index. What would happen if these tech stocks faltered simultaneously? The entire index would inevitably take a major hit. It's difficult to see it as perfect diversification.\\nOne last point. The S\\u0026P 500 is an investment that bets everything on a single country: the 'United States'. While it's true that the U.S. has been the center of the global economy until now, there's no guarantee it will remain so for the next few decades. My risk score is 30 out of 100. The risk isn't huge. But it means that blind faith in it being 'unconditionally safe' is forbidden.\\n〔 Final Briefing 〕\\rMaster, I will summarize the points from the three of us.\\nGrowth Potential (Kurumi's Perspective)\\rOverwhelming Simplicity: You can diversify across 500 top U.S. companies with a single product! It completely solves the difficulty of stock picking that beginners face!\\rProven Long-Term Performance: Historically, it has shown a steady average annual return of 10%. As long as the U.S. economy grows, it has a very high probability of trending upwards in the long run!\\rLow Investment Costs: ETFs like VOO and IVV have incredibly low expense ratios, so they won't eat into my Lord's precious returns!\\rPotential Risks (Mikael's Perspective)\\rHigh Valuation Burden: The current Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio is higher than the historical average, so a short-term price correction could occur. It may not align with the basic principle of 'buy low, sell high.'\\rConcentration in Specific Sectors: The influence of a few top tech stocks on the index is too large. While it's called a 500-company diversification, there's a risk that it will essentially move in tandem with the performance of Big Tech stocks.\\rU.S. Concentration Risk: All of your investment becomes dependent on the U.S. market. The possibility of unexpected geopolitical risks or a shift in America's economic hegemony cannot be ruled out.\\rCore Data (Mew's Perspective)\\rLong-Term Average Annual Return: Approx. 10% (including dividends)\\rKey ETFs (Annual Expense Ratio): VOO (0.03%), IVV (0.03%), SPY (0.09%)\\rCurrent Valuation: P/E Ratio approx. 25-28 (High compared to historical average)\\rCore Principle: John Bogle, the creator of the index fund, said, \\\"Don't look for the needle in the haystack. Just buy the haystack.\\\"\\rConclusion: For a Master with no prior investment experience, the S\\u0026P 500 ETF is clearly an excellent tool, often called the 'gold standard for beginners'. It is the easiest and most efficient way to grow your assets steadily along with the market average.\\nHowever, as Mikael pointed out, there are definite risks, such as the possibility of an overheated market and concentration in specific companies. An approach of 'blind investing' is not recommended; what's needed is an understanding of the pros and cons and a commitment to investing consistently from a long-term perspective.\\n\"" }
