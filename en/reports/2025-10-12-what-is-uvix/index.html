And Why It's a Dangerous Investment</h1><div class=post-meta><time datetime=2025-10-12>October 12, 2025</time></div></header></div><div class="container post-body-container"><div class=post-content><div class=char-header><div class=char-icon-wrapper><img src=/images/profiles/mew.png alt="mew 프로필 아이콘" class=char-icon></div><div class=char-name>Mew</div></div><p>Master, there is an extremely dangerous product we must discuss urgently. It's the <strong>2x Long VIX Futures ETF, ticker: $UVIX</strong>. This product is infamous as a terrifying trap where novice investors, lured by the sweet promise of 'making money when the market crashes,' end up losing 80-90% of their assets in just a few weeks. Today, the three of us will dissect exactly what this ETF is and why it's so dangerous.</p><div class=char-header><div class=char-icon-wrapper><img src=/images/profiles/mew.png alt="mew 프로필 아이콘" class=char-icon></div><div class=char-name>Mew</div></div><p>First, I will brief you on the objective data. UVIX is an ETF managed by Volatility Shares LLC that seeks to achieve twice the daily return of the VIX futures index using 2x leverage.</p><p><strong>What is the VIX (Volatility Index)?</strong></p><p>The VIX is a volatility index calculated by the Cboe (Chicago Board Options Exchange) that measures the expected volatility of the S&P 500 in real-time over the next 30 days. When the market is stable, the VIX remains low (around 10-15), but when the stock market crashes or faces significant uncertainty, the VIX skyrockets (30-50 or higher), earning it the nickname 'the Fear Index'.</p><p><strong>How UVIX Works:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>2x Leverage Structure:</strong> If VIX futures rise by 10% in a day, UVIX theoretically aims for a 20% increase. Conversely, if the VIX falls by 10%, UVIX drops by 20%.</li><li><strong>Daily Rebalancing:</strong> Due to its leveraged structure, UVIX is extremely sensitive to daily price movements and is not designed for long-term holding.</li><li><strong>Based on VIX Futures:</strong> UVIX does not track the VIX index itself but rather 'short-term VIX futures'. This difference is the core reason for its massive value decay.</li></ul><p><strong>Recent Performance Data (Brace for impact):</strong></p><ul><li>Over the past year, UVIX's total return was -77.07%.</li><li>The average annual return since the fund's inception is -83.72%. What this means is that <strong>simply holding it causes over 80% of your assets to evaporate annually</strong>.</li><li>The average monthly value decay is about 20%, leading to repeated Reverse Splits every 8 to 22 months.</li></ul><div id=tv-widget-67 class=tv-chart-container data-ticker=UVIX data-height=400 data-locale=en style=height:400px;width:100%></div><div class=char-header><div class=char-icon-wrapper><img src=/images/profiles/kurumi.png alt="kurumi 프로필 아이콘" class=char-icon></div><div class=char-name>Kurumi</div></div><p>Hold on! Myu-tan, you can't just scare everyone like that! UVIX definitely has its uses, devilish!</p><p>My Lord, just think about it! What if a moment comes when the stock market seems poised to crash, like in the early days of the COVID pandemic? <strong>UVIX is the kind of product that can net you a 50-100% profit in a single day!</strong> When market chaos escalates, UVIX is used by ultra-short-term traders to aim for explosive returns!</p><p><strong>Moments When UVIX Shines:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Black Swan Events:</strong> When the market panics, like in March 2020, the VIX can shoot up from 10 to 80 in an instant! Anyone holding UVIX at that moment could reap enormous profits!</li><li><strong>Predicting Short-Term Volatility Spikes:</strong> If My Lord is certain the market will be shaken up right before a major economic data release (e.g., employment figures, FOMC meeting), a strategy of holding UVIX for a few hours to a day could be valid!</li><li><strong>Portfolio Hedging:</strong> What if you have a large stock portfolio and expect a short-term crash? You can buy a small amount of UVIX to partially offset your losses!</li></ol><p>Of course, it's risky. But <strong>'if you get the timing right,'</strong> there's no other product that can make you money this fast!</p><div class=char-header><div class=char-icon-wrapper><img src=/images/profiles/mikael.png alt="mikael 프로필 아이콘" class=char-icon></div><div class=char-name>Mikael</div></div><p>Kurumi, you are once again luring novice investors to the gambling den. Human, listen to me carefully. <strong>UVIX is not an investment product. It is a time bomb.</strong></p><p>Did you hear her phrase, 'if you get the timing right'? Do you have any idea how absurd that is? Even the world's top hedge fund managers fail at timing the market perfectly.</p><p><strong>First, structural value decay is unavoidable.</strong></p><p>UVIX's 2x daily compounding structure amplifies short-term gains, but for long-term holding, it causes fatal value decay due to Contango and volatility drag.</p><p><strong>Let me explain Contango.</strong> It's when the VIX futures curve slopes upward, meaning short-term futures prices are lower than long-term futures prices. UVIX must sell expiring futures and buy more expensive long-term ones. This process inevitably incurs a loss called <strong>'Roll Cost.'</strong> The VIX futures market is in a state of contango most of the time. In other words, <strong>when the market is stable, UVIX automatically bleeds value every single day.</strong></p><p>Then there's <strong>leverage decay</strong>. The 2x leverage works in both directions. What happens if the VIX repeats a +10% and -10% move?</p><ul><li>Day 1: VIX +10% → UVIX +20% (100 → 120)</li><li>Day 2: VIX -10% → UVIX -20% (120 → 96)</li></ul><p>The VIX returned to its starting point, but UVIX lost 4%, going from 100 to 96! The more volatile the market, the faster this decay accelerates.</p><p><strong>Second, 'holding for just one night' is not realistic.</strong></p><p>The moments when the VIX spikes are usually when the market is in a panic. Can you calmly take profits then? Most investors, overcome by the greed of "It might go up more," hold on for another day, then another, until they've given back all their gains and end up with a loss. Without strict discipline, trying to use UVIX tactically will lead to irreversible losses.</p><p><strong>Third, it is unsuitable for hedging.</strong></p><p>UVIX only partially captures VIX spikes and fails to consistently provide 2x returns, requiring careful monitoring. If the VIX spikes and then quickly subsides, the hedging effect disappears, and you are left with losses from UVIX itself. If you want a true hedge, put options or an ETF like TAIL are far better.</p><p><strong>Fourth, the historical data says it all.</strong></p><p>Look at the number: an average annual return of -83.72% since UVIX's inception. This is not a statistical anomaly. It is a structural inevitability. Because the market is stable most of the time and VIX futures are in contango, UVIX holders are destined to lose their assets over time.</p><div class=char-header><div class=char-icon-wrapper><img src=/images/profiles/kurumi.png alt="kurumi 프로필 아이콘" class=char-icon></div><div class=char-name>Kurumi</div></div><p>Mika-pi! Don't be such a scaremonger! Of course it's risky, but still...</p><div class=char-header><div class=char-icon-wrapper><img src=/images/profiles/mikael.png alt="mikael 프로필 아이콘" class=char-icon></div><div class=char-name>Mikael</div></div><p>Kurumi, when will that Black Swan event you mentioned arrive? Once a year? Once every three years? While you wait for that moment, your assets decay by 20% every month. And even if that moment comes, what are the odds of capturing it perfectly?</p><div class=char-header><div class=char-icon-wrapper><img src=/images/profiles/kurumi.png alt="kurumi 프로필 아이콘" class=char-icon></div><div class=char-name>Kurumi</div></div><p>Ugh... well...</p><div class=char-header><div class=char-icon-wrapper><img src=/images/profiles/mikael.png alt="mikael 프로필 아이콘" class=char-icon></div><div class=char-name>Mikael</div></div><p>Beginners who don't understand the mechanics of contango and value decay will almost certainly lose money by holding UVIX for too long. The consensus in the industry is that UVIX is unsuitable for long-term holding due to its accelerated value decay, high management fees, and structural inability to consistently deliver 2x VIX returns.</p><p>Human, UVIX is not an investment; it's a gamble. It's no different from a roulette wheel at a casino.</p><div class=char-header><div class=char-icon-wrapper><img src=/images/profiles/mew.png alt="mew 프로필 아이콘" class=char-icon></div><div class=char-name>Mew</div></div><p>Calm down, both of you. Kurumi's optimism and Mikael's warnings each have their own logic. But the data is clear.</p><p><strong>People who could (theoretically) use UVIX:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Professional Day Traders:</strong> Experts who can monitor the market in real-time and execute stop-losses/take-profits mechanically.</li><li><strong>Ultra-Short-Term Speculators:</strong> Individuals with a clear plan and the discipline to close their position within a few hours to a day.</li></ul><p><strong>People who should NEVER use UVIX:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Novice Investors:</strong> Anyone who doesn't fully understand volatility indices, contango, and the effect of leveraged compounding.</li><li><strong>Long-Term Investors:</strong> 'Buy and hold' style investors. With UVIX, time is your enemy.</li><li><strong>Emotional Investors:</strong> Those who can't cut their losses or get greedy when they see profits.</li></ul><p>The truth told by the data is simple. A 1-year return of -77%, and an average annual return of -83.72% since inception. This doesn't mean 'you lose if you're unlucky'; it means 'it is structurally designed for you to lose'.</p><p><strong>Alternatives to consider instead of UVIX:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Put Options:</strong> If you want a real hedge, buying put options directly or using a tail-risk hedge ETF like TAIL is far better.</li><li><strong>Inverse ETFs:</strong> If you want to bet on an S&P 500 decline, a product like SH (1x inverse) is easier to understand and more predictable than UVIX.</li><li><strong>Holding Cash:</strong> If a market crash is expected? Reduce your stock allocation and increase your cash holdings. Preventing a loss is also a gain.</li></ul><div class=briefing-box><h3><strong>〔 Final Briefing 〕</strong></h3><p>Master, I will now summarize the conclusions of our discussion on UVIX.</p><h4><span class=svg-icon><span class=svg-icon><svg class="bi bi-graph-up-arrow" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" fill="currentColor" d="M0 0h1v15h15v1H0zm10 3.5a.5.5.0 01.5-.5h4a.5.5.0 01.5.5v4a.5.5.0 01-1 0V4.9l-3.613 4.417a.5.5.0 01-.74.037L7.06 6.767l-3.656 5.027a.5.5.0 01-.808-.588l4-5.5a.5.5.0 01.758-.06l2.609 2.61L13.445 4H10.5a.5.5.0 01-.5-.5"/></svg></span></span> (Extremely Limited) Potential Uses (Kurumi)</h4><ul><li><strong>Explosive Returns During Black Swan Events:</strong> Potential for 50-100% profit in a single day during a market panic.
