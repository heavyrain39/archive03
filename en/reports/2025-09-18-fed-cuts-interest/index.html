            <p>Master, the U.S. Federal Reserve has just decided to cut the benchmark interest rate by 25bp (0.25%p) at the September FOMC meeting. The global financial markets are buzzing with anticipation that this may finally mark the turning point in the long era of high interest rates.</p>
<p>What does this mean for Bitcoin, a representative risk asset? Is it the prelude to a new liquidity party, or a warning sign of a recession? Today, the three of us will discuss this topic.</p>

<p>Master, I will first brief you on the objective data. The Federal Reserve has lowered the target range for the federal funds rate by 25bp from the previous 4.25%-4.50% to <strong>4.00%-4.25%</strong>. As the market had already priced in a rate cut with over 96% probability, this result isn't entirely surprising. However, it holds significant symbolic meaning as the first rate cut since last December.</p>
<p>The backdrop for this rate cut includes recent U.S. economic indicators showing signs of a slowdown. The labor market, in particular, is noticeably cooling, and economic growth forecasts have also been adjusted. Although the August Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 2.9% year-over-year, still above the Fed's 2% target, concerns about an economic slowdown appear to have been a more significant factor.</p>
<p>The market reacted immediately after the announcement. The price of Bitcoin showed minor volatility and is currently trading around ₩160 million ($116,000). Market participants are hanging on every word from Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference, trying to gauge the future direction.</p>

<p>Yay! My Lord! It's finally here! This is the signal of a new era! My heart is about to explode!</p>
<p>This isn't just about a simple 0.25%p rate cut. It's an official declaration that the era of tightening the money supply is over, and a <strong>'liquidity party'</strong> is about to begin! Devilish!</p>
<p>Just think about it! What happens when interest rates go down?</p>
<p>First, the appeal of the dollar will decrease, so money will naturally flow into alternative assets like Bitcoin! Who would put their money in a bank for paltry interest? Of course, they'll turn their eyes to riskier assets in search of higher returns!</p>
<p>Second, as businesses and individuals can borrow money at cheaper rates, investment and consumption will increase. And where will all that money unleashed into the market go? It's obvious that it will eventually flow into the stock market, and into the hottest market of all—Bitcoin!</p>
<p>The market had already accepted the September rate cut as a done deal, which is why Bitcoin's price recovered to ₩160 million ($115,000). This is just the beginning! The Fed has hinted at two more rate cuts within the year. That's like continuously injecting rocket fuel for Bitcoin's next rally!</p>

<p>Kurumi, you are so intoxicated by the sound of the celebration that you fail to see why the cannons are being fired. I do not see this situation as entirely rosy. In fact, it seems like a warning light has just turned on.</p>
<p>First, let's rephrase the question. <strong>Why do central banks lower interest rates?</strong> It's because they anticipate the economy will worsen. In other words, they lower rates <strong>to prevent a recession</strong>. The main reasons for this rate cut were a 'cooling labor market' and 'slowing economic growth.' This is a clear signal that the economic fundamentals are weakening.</p>
<p>Second, what happens if a real recession hits? People will tighten their wallets, and businesses will cut back on investments. In such a situation, what are the first assets investors sell off? High-risk assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies. The moment the fear of a recession outweighs the hope of increased liquidity, the market could rapidly shift from a 'Risk-on' to a 'Risk-off' phase. We must remember that there have been many cases in the past where asset markets rallied briefly after an initial rate cut, only to fall more sharply as the economic slowdown became apparent.</p>
<p>Third, the fact that it was 'as expected' can be a trap. The market had already priced in this rate cut with over 96% certainty, and that expectation is largely reflected in the current price. We cannot rule out the possibility of a 'Sell the News' phenomenon leading to a short-term correction.</p>
<p>A rate cut is a double-edged sword. It has the positive aspect of supplying liquidity and the negative aspect of signaling an economic slowdown. Which side will come to dominate the market can only be known by calmly observing the economic data that will be released going forward.</p>
<p><strong>🚨 Mikael's Risk Score: 80/100</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A rate cut may look like sweet medicine, but it could actually be a diagnosis that the patient is critically ill.</p>

<h3><strong>〔 Final Briefing 〕</strong></h3>
<p>Master, I will summarize our three perspectives for you.</p>

</svg></span></span> Growth Potential (Kurumi)</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Signal for Liquidity Supply:</strong> This rate cut is a symbolic event marking the end of tightening and the beginning of liquidity expansion, which could significantly improve investor sentiment towards risk assets.</li>
    <li><strong>Dollar Weakness and Rise of Alternative Assets:</strong> A rate cut reduces the attractiveness of the dollar, which in turn relatively increases the appeal of Bitcoin as a store of value.</li>
    <li><strong>Expectations of Further Cuts:</strong> As the Fed has hinted at the possibility of more rate cuts within the year, the anticipation for a Bitcoin rally could continue.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Precursor to Recession:</strong> Since the fundamental reason for the rate cut is concern about an economic slowdown, a full-blown recession could spread risk-aversion sentiment, which would be detrimental to Bitcoin.</li>
    <li><strong>Expectations Already Priced In:</strong> As the market had already anticipated the rate cut, a 'Sell the News' event could occur as the catalyst has been exhausted.</li>
    <li><strong>Limited Effect:</strong> A mere 0.25%p cut may have a limited impact on the real economy and could be insufficient to change the market's direction.</li>

</ul>

<div class="final-conclusion">
    <p>Master, this rate cut is clearly a 'double-edged sword' for the Bitcoin market. It could be interpreted as a signal for liquidity expansion and become a catalyst for a rally, as Kurumi says. However, it could also be a warning sign of a recession, as Mikael cautions. In the short term, market expectations may push prices up, but the mid- to long-term direction will likely be determined by whether upcoming inflation and employment data support a 'soft landing' scenario that avoids a recession. This is a time that calls for both excitement and composure.</p>
