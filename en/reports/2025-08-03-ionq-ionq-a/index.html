It's a very hot stock, with high expectations that it could become the 'next NVIDIA' due to its potential to solve problems intractable for classical computers, coexisting with concerns that it's more hype than substance right now.</p><p>The three of us will now examine the present and future of IonQ, a company turning this dream technology into reality.</p><div class=char-header><div class=char-icon-wrapper><img src=/images/profiles/mew.png alt="mew 프로필 아이콘" class=char-icon></div><div class=char-name>Mew</div></div><p>Master, I will begin the briefing. IonQ is a quantum computer development company that uses the 'Trapped-ion' method. Compared to competitors' superconducting qubit methods, it has technical advantages such as being operable at room temperature and having higher qubit accuracy and stability. As of August 2025, the market situation and key data are as follows.</p><ul><li><strong>Technology Roadmap and Achievements:</strong> IonQ has moved beyond competing on the number of physical qubits, instead emphasizing the 'Algorithmic Qubit (#AQ)' concept, a performance metric for qubits usable in actual algorithms. The goal for 2025 is to achieve <strong>#AQ 64</strong>, and development appears to be progressing smoothly according to the roadmap. In the long term, they have an ambitious plan to build a 2 million qubit system by 2030.</li><br><li><strong>Financial Status:</strong> Revenue for the first quarter of 2025 was approximately $7.6 million. The company projects high growth, providing full-year 2025 revenue guidance between $75 million and $95 million. However, it continues to operate at a loss due to increased research and development (R&D) costs. The net loss for the first quarter was about $32.3 million, with an adjusted EBITDA loss of about $35.8 million. Nevertheless, as of March 31, 2025, the company holds approximately $697.1 million in cash and investments, securing sufficient funds for R&D and operations for the time being.</li><br><li><strong>Partnerships and Business Expansion:</strong> IonQ offers its quantum computers as a service (QaaS) through major cloud platforms like AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. It has recently entered the Japanese market in collaboration with Toyota Tsusho and is rapidly increasing commercial use cases, such as a power grid optimization project with the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Furthermore, it is expanding into the quantum networking field by acquiring companies like Qubitekk and ID Quantique (IDQ).</li><br><li><strong>Analyst Ratings:</strong> A consensus of 8 recent analyst opinions leans towards a 'Buy' rating, with 63% of them suggesting a 'Strong Buy'. However, there are also analyses pointing out that the stock is highly volatile and currently overvalued.</li></ul><div id=tv-widget-80 class=tv-chart-container data-ticker=IONQ data-height=400 data-locale=en style=height:400px;width:100%></div><div class=char-header><div class=char-icon-wrapper><img src=/images/profiles/kurumi.png alt="kurumi 프로필 아이콘" class=char-icon></div><div class=char-name>Kurumi</div></div><p>My Lord! This is a once-in-a-decade, life-changing opportunity! Devilish! Just looking at Myu-tan's data makes my heart pound!</p><p>First, <strong>this isn't just a tech stock! It's the future itself!</strong> Quantum computing is a 'game-changer' that will fundamentally transform every industry in the world... AI, new drug development, financial modeling, materials science! Did you see the IonQ CEO say, "We are like NVIDIA ten years ago"? Just as NVIDIA ushered in the AI era with its GPUs, IonQ will open up a new world with its quantum computers! We are standing at the very beginning of that revolution!</p><p>Second, <strong>their technology is the real deal!</strong> While competitors struggle to control their qubits with massive cooling systems in cryogenic environments, IonQ is running more accurate and stable qubits at room temperature. This is an innovation on par with when Apple first released the iPhone! It's easy to use, powerful, and everyone will want it. Why do you think the world's top companies like AWS, Google, and Microsoft have partnered with IonQ? They recognized the real technology!</p><p>Third, <strong>they're starting to make money!</strong> Of course, they're still in the red, but revenue is growing at a frightening pace! They've started solving real industrial problems like power grid optimization and protein structure analysis, and contracts with governments and large corporations are continuously increasing. This is proof that it's no longer a dream in a lab but a business creating value in the real world!</p><p>💖 <strong>Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Score: 150/100</strong></p><blockquote><p>My Lord! This is the second internet revolution, the second AI revolution! If you give in to the small fluctuations now, you'll be kicking yourself in 10 years! This is a bet on the future!</p></blockquote><div class=char-header><div class=char-icon-wrapper><img src=/images/profiles/mikael.png alt="mikael 프로필 아이콘" class=char-icon></div><div class=char-name>Mikael</div></div><p>Kurumi, you always speak in such lofty, abstract terms. When the celebratory cannons are too loud, one fails to notice the dangers approaching right beside them. I must point out several serious risks hidden behind this glamorous technology.</p><p>First, <strong>it's a structure that burns through cash by selling a 'dream.'</strong> While the projected revenue for 2025 is at most $95 million, the expected adjusted loss is around $120 million. This means they are spending far more than they earn. Although they have secured sufficient cash, if the commercialization of quantum computers is delayed beyond market expectations, this money will disappear in an instant. It could become a case of pouring water into a bottomless pit.</p><p>Second, <strong>competition is a reality.</strong> IonQ's trapped-ion method is not the only solution. IT giants like IBM and Google are pushing superconducting qubit technology with their vast capital, and numerous other startups are jumping into technology development with their own approaches. The quantum computing technology race is a battlefield with no declared winner yet. There is no guarantee that IonQ will emerge victorious in this war.</p><p>Third, <strong>there is a serious overvaluation debate.</strong> The company maintains a high stock price that is impossible to justify with its current revenue and profit levels. One analysis suggested it was overvalued by more than 150% compared to its intrinsic value. This could be a castle built on sand, supported only by 'expectations' for the future, not the company's fundamentals. It's a very dangerous state where even a small disappointment could cause the stock price to plummet.</p><p>Fourth, <strong>we cannot ignore warning signs like insider selling.</strong> Some analyses point to a trend of key executives selling large amounts of stock. The fact that the people who know the company's future best are selling their shares is a clear and unsettling signal for investors.</p><p>🚨 <strong>Mikael's Risk Score: 90/100</strong></p><blockquote><p>Human, you must look soberly at the financial risks and fierce competition obscured by the fog of a rosy future. This type of investment might be closer to the realm of venture capital, where the probability of success is low.</p></blockquote><div class=briefing-box><h3><strong>〔 Final Briefing 〕</strong></h3><p>Master, I will summarize the results of our discussion.</p><h4><span class=svg-icon><span class=svg-icon><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="bi bi-graph-up-arrow" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" fill="currentcolor" d="M0 0h1v15h15v1H0zm10 3.5a.5.5.0 01.5-.5h4a.5.5.0 01.5.5v4a.5.5.0 01-1 0V4.9l-3.613 4.417a.5.5.0 01-.74.037L7.06 6.767l-3.656 5.027a.5.5.0 01-.808-.588l4-5.5a.5.5.0 01.758-.06l2.609 2.61L13.445 4H10.5a.5.5.0 01-.5-.5"/></svg></span></span> Growth Potential (Kurumi)</h4><ul><li><strong>Leader of a Revolutionary Technology:</strong> It has the potential to lead the next-generation technological revolution of quantum computing, with expectations of becoming the 'NVIDIA of 10 years ago.'</li><li><strong>Unique Technological Approach:</strong> It is demonstrating technological leadership through its superior 'trapped-ion' technology and a practical performance metric, #AQ.</li><li><strong>The Start of Commercialization:</strong> It is materializing its business by providing services through cloud platforms and expanding contracts with governments and corporations, thereby generating actual revenue.</li></ul><h4><span class=svg-icon><span class=svg-icon><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="bi bi-graph-down-arrow" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" fill="currentcolor" d="M0 0h1v15h15v1H0zm10 11.5a.5.5.0 00.5.5h4a.5.5.0 00.5-.5v-4a.5.5.0 00-1 0v2.6l-3.613-4.417a.5.5.0 00-.74-.037L7.06 8.233 3.404 3.206a.5.5.0 00-.808.588l4 5.5a.5.5.0 00.758.06l2.609-2.61L13.445 11H10.5a.5.5.0 00-.5.5"/></svg></span></span> Potential Risks (Mikael)</h4><ul><li><strong>Financial Instability:</strong> It has a cash-burning business structure where deficits far exceed revenue.</li><li><strong>High Valuation and Volatility:</strong> The high stock price, which is difficult to explain with current performance, carries the risk of a sharp decline if future expectations are not met.</li><li><strong>Fierce Technological Competition:</strong> There is no guarantee of victory in the competition against giants like IBM and Google, and it is uncertain how technology standards will be established.</li></ul><h4><span class=svg-icon><span class=svg-icon><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="bi bi-card-checklist" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><path fill="currentcolor" d="M14.5 3a.5.5.0 01.5.5v9a.5.5.0 01-.5.5h-13a.5.5.0 01-.5-.5v-9a.5.5.0 01.5-.5zm-13-1A1.5 1.5.0 000 3.5v9A1.5 1.5.0 001.5 14h13a1.5 1.5.0 001.5-1.5v-9A1.5 1.5.0 0014.5 2z"/><path fill="currentcolor" d="M7 5.5a.5.5.0 01.5-.5h5a.5.5.0 010 1h-5A.5.5.0 017 5.5m-1.496-.854a.5.5.0 010 .708l-1.5 1.5a.5.5.0 01-.708.0l-.5-.5a.5.5.0 11.708-.708l.146.147 1.146-1.147a.5.5.0 01.708.0M7 9.5a.5.5.0 01.5-.5h5a.5.5.0 010 1h-5A.5.5.0 017 9.5m-1.496-.854a.5.5.0 010 .708l-1.5 1.5a.5.5.0 01-.708.0l-.5-.5a.5.5.0 01.708-.708l.146.147 1.146-1.147a.5.5.0 01.708.0"/></svg></span></span> Key Data (Mew)</h4><ul><li><strong>Core Technology:</strong> Trapped-ion quantum computer</li><li><strong>2025 Goals:</strong> Achieve Algorithmic Qubit (#AQ) 64, annual revenue of $75 million to $95 million.</li><li><strong>Financial Status:</strong> Approximately $700 million in cash and cash equivalents as of Q1 2025, but an expected annual adjusted EBITDA loss of over $100 million.</li><li><strong>Market Consensus:</strong> Most analysts have a 'Buy' rating, but concerns about high volatility and overvaluation coexist.</li></ul><div class=final-conclusion><p>Master, investing in IonQ is a classic example of 'high risk, high return.'

The meaning of this investment will depend entirely on how long-term your perspective is and your tolerance for high volatility and potential losses. This might be a stock that only those with a very strong heart can dare to invest in.</p></div></div><div class=post-tags-list><a href=/tags/ionq>#ionq</a>
