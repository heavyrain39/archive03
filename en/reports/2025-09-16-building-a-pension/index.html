Let's Dive into the $SCHD ETF</h1><div class=post-meta><time datetime=2025-09-15>September 15, 2025</time></div></header></div><div class="container post-body-container"><div class=post-content><p>Welcome, Master. Today is Monday, September 15, 2025.</p><p>As you requested, we're going to talk about 'America's leading dividend growth ETF', the <strong>Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF</strong>, ticker <strong>$SCHD</strong>. We'll dig into the true nature of this ETF, which is so beloved it's nicknamed "the textbook of dividend investing" and "a must-have for retirement accounts."</p><div class=char-header><div class=char-icon-wrapper><img src=/images/profiles/mew.png alt="mew 프로필 아이콘" class=char-icon></div><div class=char-name>Mew</div></div><p>Master, first, I will brief you on the objective data for SCHD.</p><p>SCHD is not just a 'high-dividend ETF' that gathers companies with high dividend yields. It tracks the 'Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index,' and to be included, a company must pass very strict criteria.</p><ul><li><strong>A minimum 10-year history of continuous dividend payments</strong> is required.</li><li>Beyond simple dividend yield, it comprehensively evaluates metrics like <strong>Cash Flow to Total Debt, Return on Equity (ROE), Dividend Yield, and 5-Year Dividend Growth Rate</strong> to select 100 companies that are financially robust and have a high probability of consistently increasing dividends in the future.</li></ul><p>Simply put, it's an ETF that only picks 'blue-chip companies that have paid good dividends in the past, are earning well now, and are likely to increase dividends in the future.'</p><p>Now, let's look at the top 10 holdings of SCHD as of September 15, 2025.</p><p>At the very top of the portfolio is the global integrated energy giant <strong>Chevron (CVX)</strong>. Following that, the global pharmaceutical company <strong>AbbVie (ABBV)</strong>, famous for its immunology and oncology treatments, stands as a pillar in the healthcare sector. In the consumer staples sector, it includes America's largest tobacco company <strong>Altria (MO)</strong>, famous for Marlboro, and the food and beverage giant <strong>PepsiCo (PEP)</strong>, which owns brands like Pepsi-Cola and Lay's. Another energy company, <strong>ConocoPhillips (COP)</strong>, is also in the top ranks, showing the significant weight of the energy sector in the current SCHD portfolio. As you can see, the top holdings of SCHD are dominated by representatives of traditional value industries.</p><p>Finally, here are the key metrics.</p><ul><li><strong>Expense Ratio:</strong> 0.06% per year (very low)</li><li><strong>Trailing 12-Month Dividend Yield:</strong> Approximately 3.77%</li><li><strong>Total Assets Under Management (AUM):</strong> Approximately $71.8 billion (about 98 trillion KRW)</li></ul><div id=tv-widget-95 class=tv-chart-container data-ticker=SCHD data-height=400 data-locale=en style=height:400px;width:100%></div><div class=char-header><div class=char-icon-wrapper><img src=/images/profiles/kurumi.png alt="kurumi 프로필 아이콘" class=char-icon></div><div class=char-name>Kurumi</div></div><p>Wow! My Lord! Look at this perfect portfolio! Devilish! This isn't just giving you money; it's a 'golden goose' that makes money work for itself and lay more eggs! Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Score: 95/100!</p><p>First, <strong>the 'quality' is on another level!</strong> These aren't some withering companies that just pay out a lot in dividends; they're a collection of champions that dominate the world in their respective fields! Pepsi-Cola, Home Depot, Verizon! These are companies we use and see every day, companies that simply can't fail. They won't even flinch if the economy stumbles a bit. In fact, they use crises as opportunities to expand their market dominance!</p><p>Second, <strong>'dividends' and 'growth' at the same time!</strong> This is the core of it! SCHD is a strategy that catches two birds with one stone, depositing cash into your account every quarter while the companies grow and their stock prices rise along with them. If you reinvest the dividends to buy more stock, the magic of compounding will snowball, and eventually, your assets will be working for you even while you sleep! The saying "SCHD is my pension" isn't for nothing!</p><p>Third, <strong>could there be a more stress-free investment?</strong> Our heads would explode if we had to study and analyze each of these amazing companies to invest. But by just buying SCHD, you become an owner of all these champion companies! And you do it for a pittance of a fee, just 0.06% a year!</p><p>My Lord! This isn't speculation aiming for a short-term jackpot. This is about meeting the most reliable partner in the world, one that will gift you financial freedom in 10 or 20 years!</p><div class=char-header><div class=char-icon-wrapper><img src=/images/profiles/mikael.png alt="mikael 프로필 아이콘" class=char-icon></div><div class=char-name>Mikael</div></div><p>Kurumi, I acknowledge your passion. But you must not forget that every investment has a shadow. You need to face the cold reality hidden behind the sweet dividends.</p><p>First, <strong>its growth potential is clearly limited.</strong> Look at the portfolio. Energy, consumer staples, telecommunications, pharmaceuticals... most are 'value stocks' that have reached maturity. While these companies may be stable, it's difficult to expect the explosive growth seen in innovative tech stocks that lead the market. In a bull market driven by growth stocks, it's highly likely to underperform the S&P 500 index. This is less an investment for 'growing' assets and more for 'protecting' them.</p><p>Second, <strong>there is a sector concentration risk.</strong> Just looking at the top 10 holdings, the weight of energy, healthcare, and consumer staples is high. If oil prices plummet or government regulations on the healthcare industry tighten, the entire ETF could take a hit. Although it's said to be 'diversified,' you shouldn't overlook the fact that its structure can be vulnerable to specific economic conditions.</p><p>Third, <strong>it can become less attractive during periods of interest rate hikes.</strong> Dividend stocks like SCHD are in competition with bank deposits and bonds. If the central bank continues to raise the benchmark interest rate, investors will turn their eyes to safe deposits or bonds instead of taking on the volatility risk of the stock market. This would reduce the relative appeal of dividend stocks and could negatively affect their prices.</p><p>Finally, <strong>do not fall under the illusion that this is a 'safe asset.'</strong> SCHD is also an ETF composed 100% of stocks. It will fall just like everything else in a global economic crisis or market collapse. Of course, the dividends will partially cushion the impact of the decline, but you must remember that it is by no means a product free from the risk of principal loss.</p><p>I would rate the risk score of this investment at <strong>40 points</strong>. The risk isn't extremely high, but that also means the expected return is just as limited.</p><div class=briefing-box><h3><strong>〔 Final Briefing 〕</strong></h3><p>Master, I will summarize the conversation we three have had.</p><h4><span class=svg-icon><span class=svg-icon><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="bi bi-graph-up-arrow" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" fill="currentcolor" d="M0 0h1v15h15v1H0zm10 3.5a.5.5.0 01.5-.5h4a.5.5.0 01.5.5v4a.5.5.0 01-1 0V4.9l-3.613 4.417a.5.5.0 01-.74.037L7.06 6.767l-3.656 5.027a.5.5.0 01-.808-.588l4-5.5a.5.5.0 01.758-.06l2.609 2.61L13.445 4H10.5a.5.5.0 01-.5-.5"/></svg></span></span> Growth Potential (Kurumi)</h4><ul><li><strong>Top-Tier Quality:</strong> It's composed only of financially robust, blue-chip companies that represent their industries, making it incredibly stable!

As Kurumi said, it can be an exceptionally fine choice for a long-term investor seeking steady cash flow and stable asset growth. However, as Mikael warned, it should not be considered a panacea that promises explosive growth or can evade all market risks. The value of this ETF will look entirely different depending on where your investment goals lie and how much market volatility you can tolerate.</p></div></div><div class=post-tags-list><a href=/tags/schd>#schd</a>
