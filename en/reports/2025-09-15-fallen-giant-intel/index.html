It's the morning of Monday, September 15, 2025. Today's topic is a company that was once the emperor of the semiconductor empire but is now dreaming of a massive comeback from the position of a challenger: <strong>Intel ($INTC)</strong>. Let's examine whether Intel's ambitious plan can succeed and if its current stock price represents an opportunity right before a major takeoff.</p><div class=char-header><div class=char-icon-wrapper><img src=/images/profiles/mew.png alt="mew 프로필 아이콘" class=char-icon></div><div class=char-name>Mew</div></div><p>Master, I will begin with an objective data briefing on Intel's current situation. As of September 2025, under the leadership of CEO Pat Gelsinger, Intel is waging a fight for its future by implementing a massive transition strategy called 'IDM 2.0'.</p><ul><li><strong>Stock Price & Valuation:</strong> The current stock price is hovering around the $35-$40 range. Due to recent poor performance, the stock has fallen significantly, creating an illusion that it is cheap on traditional valuation metrics like the Price-to-Earnings (PER) or Price-to-Sales (PSR) ratios compared to its competitors.</li><br><li><strong>Recent Earnings:</strong> The latest quarterly results show that the Client Computing Group (CCG) is still struggling due to the slow recovery of the PC market. The Data Center and AI (DCAI) group also recorded results below expectations due to intensified competition with AMD and the slow market penetration of its own AI accelerator, 'Gaudi'. In particular, gross profit margins and cash flow have significantly deteriorated due to massive capital expenditures (CAPEX) for building new fabs.</li><br><li><strong>Foundry (IFS) Status:</strong> The foundry business, on which Intel's future depends, is currently the most critical variable. The core of this is the <strong>18A (1.8-nanometer class) process</strong>, the final stage of the 'five nodes in four years (5N4Y)' roadmap. Recently, news of yields hovering around 10% has raised concerns about its technological maturity. However, Intel maintains that it will complete production readiness by the end of the year as scheduled and plans to produce its next-generation CPU, 'Panther Lake', using the 18A process.</li><br><li><strong>AI Accelerator 'Gaudi':</strong> In the AI chip market, where Nvidia holds over 90% of the share, Intel has thrown down the gauntlet with its 'Gaudi' series. It has promoted a lower price than Nvidia's H100 and an open ecosystem as its weapons, but its market share is still negligible.</li><br><li><strong>Government Support:</strong> The U.S. government is providing Intel with substantial subsidies under the CHIPS Act. Recently, there were discussions about the government acquiring about 10% of Intel's shares to become the largest shareholder in exchange for approximately $10.9 billion in subsidies. This would ease Intel's financial burden but also signifies increased government influence over its management.</li></ul><div id=tv-widget-75 class=tv-chart-container data-ticker=INTC data-height=400 data-locale=en style=height:400px;width:100%></div><div class=char-header><div class=char-icon-wrapper><img src=/images/profiles/kurumi.png alt="kurumi 프로필 아이콘" class=char-icon></div><div class=char-name>Kurumi</div></div><p>Mika-pi is bound to list off worries, but in my eyes, this all looks like an opportunity! My Lord, this is like a legendary hero right before they awaken after facing trials!</p><p><strong>First, a grand comeback story named 'Foundry'!</strong> It's noisy now with yield issues, but what if Intel actually succeeds with the 18A process? The entire world, which has been relying solely on TSMC and Samsung, will have a powerful American alternative in the cutting-edge semiconductor supply chain! This isn't just a company's success; it's a project with America's national pride on the line! That's precisely why the government is supporting it to the point of becoming the largest shareholder. As geopolitical risks grow, the demand for 'Made in USA' advanced chips is bound to explode!</p><p><strong>Second, while everyone is looking at Nvidia, you have to see the value of being number two!</strong> That's right, Nvidia is dominating the AI market right now. But as the market grows, monopolies are destined to be broken. Companies are desperately looking for alternatives to expensive Nvidia chips, and Intel's 'Gaudi' has the clear weapons of price competitiveness and openness. A world that only remembers the winner is no fun, right? There will always be an opening for the second and third players to squeeze in!</p><p><strong>Third, the new wave of 'AI PCs'!</strong> Everyone is talking about data center AI, but the real money might just explode from the PCs in our hands. When the era of running AI directly on PCs arrives, an opportunity will come again for Intel, which makes powerful CPUs. Just imagine AI PCs equipped with Intel's ultra-high-performance 'Panther Lake' CPUs, made with the 18A process, sweeping the market! Isn't it thrilling just to think about? Devilish!</p><p>The current stock price reflects all sorts of worries and anxieties. The moment Intel overcomes this ordeal and rises again, today's price will become a historic low that we'll never see again!</p><p>💖 <strong>Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Score: 85/100</strong></p><blockquote><p>Believing in the return of an emperor who once ruled the world... isn't that a truly heart-pounding investment?!</p></blockquote><div class=char-header><div class=char-icon-wrapper><img src=/images/profiles/mikael.png alt="mikael 프로필 아이콘" class=char-icon></div><div class=char-name>Mikael</div></div><p>The assumption 'if they succeed' is always sweet. However, Human, investing requires looking at reality, not dreams. I see serious cracks in this grand empire's reconstruction plan.</p><p><strong>First, the most fatal 'execution risk'.</strong> Intel's biggest enemy is not AMD or TSMC, but its past self. Over the last decade, Intel has failed in numerous process transitions and lost credibility by not keeping its promised roadmaps. The 'five nodes in four years' plan is the most aggressive roadmap in history. Can they really pull this off perfectly without repeating past failures? The recent low yield issue with the 18A process is a very dangerous signal that amplifies this anxiety.</p><p><strong>Second, the competitors are not sleeping lions.</strong> While Intel is pouring money and time just to catch up, TSMC, AMD, and Nvidia are racing far ahead. TSMC is already on the verge of mass-producing its stable 2-nanometer process, and Nvidia has built an impregnable fortress in the AI market with its 'CUDA' software ecosystem. It's already a struggle for Intel just to close the technology gap; snatching away the dominance of entrenched competitors is a nearly impossible mission.</p><p><strong>Third, the black hole of astronomical costs.</strong> The foundry business is a 'money pit' that requires continuous massive capital investment. The U.S. government's subsidies are not enough, and they are even undergoing large-scale restructuring. When will this poured money ever turn into profit? If the foundry business continues to fail to escape deficits, Intel's financial structure could be damaged beyond recovery. This is a risk that threatens the very existence of the company.</p><p><strong>Fourth, the market's assessment is cold.</strong> Kurumi talks about Gaudi's price competitiveness, but the market is still fanatical about Nvidia while ignoring Intel's stock. The reality of the AI market is that money flows not to the 'cheap and good' product, but to the 'most certain' one.</p><p>This investment has much to gain upon success, but what you stand to lose upon failure is far greater. It's closer to a very dangerous gamble.</p><p>🚨 <strong>Mikael's Risk Score: 90/100</strong></p><blockquote><p>You must face the structural risks hidden behind the flashy reconstruction plan, which could shake the very foundation. There's always a reason why something looks cheap.</p></blockquote><div class=briefing-box><h3><strong>〔 Final Briefing 〕</strong></h3><p>Master, I will summarize the results of our discussion.</p><h4><span class=svg-icon><span class=svg-icon><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="bi bi-graph-up-arrow" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" fill="currentcolor" d="M0 0h1v15h15v1H0zm10 3.5a.5.5.0 01.5-.5h4a.5.5.0 01.5.5v4a.5.5.0 01-1 0V4.9l-3.613 4.417a.5.5.0 01-.74.037L7.06 6.767l-3.656 5.027a.5.5.0 01-.808-.588l4-5.5a.5.5.0 01.758-.06l2.609 2.61L13.445 4H10.5a.5.5.0 01-.5-.5"/></svg></span></span> Growth Potential (Kurumi)</h4><ul><li><strong>Foundry Business Transformation:</strong> If the 18A process succeeds, Intel could absorb the huge demand from the market looking for an alternative to TSMC, emerging as the core semiconductor supply chain for the Western world!</li><li><strong>Niche Strategy in the AI Market:</strong> As a reaction against Nvidia's monopoly, 'Gaudi', with its price competitiveness and open ecosystem, could establish itself as a meaningful number two in the AI accelerator market!</li><li><strong>The Dawn of the AI PC Era:</strong> When the on-device AI market fully opens, Intel has ample potential to reclaim leadership in the PC market based on its strong CPU technology!</li></ul><h4><span class=svg-icon><span class=svg-icon><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="bi bi-graph-down-arrow" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" fill="currentcolor" d="M0 0h1v15h15v1H0zm10 11.5a.5.5.0 00.5.5h4a.5.5.0 00.5-.5v-4a.5.5.0 00-1 0v2.6l-3.613-4.417a.5.5.0 00-.74-.037L7.06 8.233 3.404 3.206a.5.5.0 00-.808.588l4 5.5a.5.5.0 00.758.06l2.609-2.61L13.445 11H10.5a.5.5.0 00-.5.5"/></svg></span></span> Potential Risks (Mikael)</h4><ul><li><strong>High Execution Risk and Technological Uncertainty:</strong> The success of the aggressive 'five nodes in four years' roadmap is uncertain, and the 18A process yield issue, in particular, could hobble the plan.</li><li><strong>Fierce Competitive Environment:</strong> The overwhelming competitors in each field—TSMC in foundry, AMD in CPUs, and Nvidia in AI accelerators—will not easily allow Intel's comeback.</li><li><strong>Massive Financial Burden:</strong> The astronomical investment costs required for new fab construction are continuously pressuring profitability, and if success is delayed, it could lead to a serious financial crisis.</li></ul><h4><span class=svg-icon><span class=svg-icon><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="bi bi-card-checklist" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><path fill="currentcolor" d="M14.5 3a.5.5.0 01.5.5v9a.5.5.0 01-.5.5h-13a.5.5.0 01-.5-.5v-9a.5.5.0 01.5-.5zm-13-1A1.5 1.5.0 000 3.5v9A1.5 1.5.0 001.5 14h13a1.5 1.5.0 001.5-1.5v-9A1.5 1.5.0 0014.5 2z"/><path fill="currentcolor" d="M7 5.5a.5.5.0 01.5-.5h5a.5.5.0 010 1h-5A.5.5.0 017 5.5m-1.496-.854a.5.5.0 010 .708l-1.5 1.5a.5.5.0 01-.708.0l-.5-.5a.5.5.0 11.708-.708l.146.147 1.146-1.147a.5.5.0 01.708.0M7 9.5a.5.5.0 01.5-.5h5a.5.5.0 010 1h-5A.5.5.0 017 9.5m-1.496-.854a.5.5.0 010 .708l-1.5 1.5a.5.5.0 01-.708.0l-.5-.5a.5.5.0 01.708-.708l.146.147 1.146-1.147a.5.5.0 01.708.0"/></svg></span></span> Key Data (Mew)</h4><ul><li><strong>Core Strategy:</strong> IDM 2.0 (Internal production + external foundry utilization + developing its own foundry business)</li><li><strong>Core Technology:</strong> Goal to complete 18A (1.8nm-class) process production readiness by year-end (low yield issues currently raised)</li><li><strong>Market Competition:</strong> Continuously losing market share to AMD in the CPU market, with a negligible presence in the AI accelerator market.</li><li><strong>Key Variables:</strong> The scale and method of U.S. government CHIPS Act subsidies, and whether technological stability of the 18A process can be secured.</li></ul><div class=final-conclusion><p>Master, investing in Intel is a classic example of a 'contrarian investment in a fallen giant'. As Kurumi said, if Pat Gelsinger's vision becomes a reality, the current stock price could be an unimaginable opportunity. However, as Mikael pointed out, the path is fraught with numerous technical, financial, and competitive hurdles. It's like a tightrope walk where failing to overcome even one obstacle could lead to a plunge into the abyss. This investment is not for those expecting short-term results, but rather a suitable choice only for a Master with strong patience and risk tolerance who can believe in Intel's long-term comeback story and stick with it for at least 3-5 years.</p></div></div><div class=post-tags-list><a href=/tags/intel>#intel</a>
