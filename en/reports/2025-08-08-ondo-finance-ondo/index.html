On August 8, 2025, our topic is the project currently receiving the most fervent attention from both the financial and crypto markets: <strong>Ondo Finance ($ONDO)</strong>.</p><p>We three will meticulously analyze whether this project, known as the leader in the 'Real-World Asset (RWA)' sector for bringing real-world financial assets onto the blockchain, will become a new bridge for Wall Street's capital or a dangerous one filled only with hype.</p><div class=char-header><div class=char-icon-wrapper><img src=/images/profiles/mew.png alt="mew 프로필 아이콘" class=char-icon></div><div class=char-name>Mew</div></div><p>Master, I will begin the briefing. In short, Ondo Finance is a project that <strong>'tokenizes high-quality real-world assets like U.S. Treasuries to make them tradable on-chain.'</strong> Instead of complex DeFi products, it brings proven, real-world financial instruments onto the blockchain.</p><p>As of August 8, 2025, the market data is as follows.</p><ul><li><strong>Key Products:</strong><ul><li><strong>OUSG (Ondo Short-Term US Government Treasuries):</strong> This is a tokenized product of an ETF that invests in short-term U.S. Treasuries. In effect, it allows you to invest in U.S. Treasuries with crypto and earn interest. Among the collateral for this product is the <strong>BUIDL fund managed by BlackRock</strong>, the world's largest asset manager, which has earned it significant market trust.</li><li><strong>USDY (Ondo U.S. Dollar Yield):</strong> This is a yield-bearing stablecoin-like product collateralized by U.S. Treasuries and bank deposits.</li></ul></li><br><li><strong>Current Price and Market Cap:</strong> The $ONDO token is currently trading at around <strong>$1.02</strong>. It has recently seen an uptrend due to news like its listing on Robinhood, and it is also being actively traded in the Korean Won market.</li><br><li><strong>Core Feature (RWA):</strong> Ondo Finance serves as a bridge connecting Traditional Finance (TradFi) and Decentralized Finance (DeFi). It is designed to allow institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals to enjoy the efficiency of the blockchain while complying with regulations. Because of this, investing in products like OUSG requires a KYC (Know Your Customer) process, adopting a 'Permissioned' model that is somewhat distant from complete decentralization.</li><br><li><strong>Tokenomics:</strong> The $ONDO token is used as a governance token for the 'Ondo DAO,' which determines the project's direction. However, the large amount of supply that has not yet been unlocked could act as potential selling pressure.</li></ul><p>Looking at the data, Ondo Finance appears to be rapidly capturing the RWA sector, backed by a strong partner in 'BlackRock' and the safest asset, 'U.S. Treasuries.' This concludes the briefing.</p><div id=tv-widget-80 class=tv-chart-container data-ticker=ONDOUSD data-height=400 data-locale=en style=height:400px;width:100%></div><div class=char-header><div class=char-icon-wrapper><img src=/images/profiles/kurumi.png alt="kurumi 프로필 아이콘" class=char-icon></div><div class=char-name>Kurumi</div></div><p>My Lord! This is a true revolution! Devilish! A 'real bridge' has finally been built for Wall Street's massive capital to flow into the crypto market! <strong>Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Score: 95/100</strong>!</p><p>First, the <strong>cheat code named 'BlackRock'!</strong> Do you understand what it means to have the world's #1 asset manager as a partner? It's basically a seal of approval that says 'invest with confidence'! What could institutions possibly trust to invest in crypto? But a U.S. Treasury token involving BlackRock? That changes the story completely. This provides an incomparable level of trust!</p><p>Second, the <strong>infinite potential of the RWA market!</strong> Can you even imagine how massive the global stock, bond, and real estate markets are combined? Now imagine those assets being tokenized and traded 24/7. Ondo Finance is the pioneer of that colossal market! Ondo even declared that "2025 will be the year of tokenized stocks." It's starting with treasuries now, but once it tokenizes everything from stocks to real estate, ONDO's value will pierce the heavens!</p><p>Third, <strong>real demand!</strong> This is different from those coins that just talk about 'future technology' in the clouds. People holding stablecoins were disappointed by the lack of interest, and institutions lacked suitable investment options, but ONDO has solved that problem! Earning U.S. Treasury interest with crypto? That's a devilishly brilliant idea! The rapid growth of its TVL (Total Value Locked) is proof of that!</p><p>This isn't just speculation! It's about becoming part of an innovation that's opening a new financial era! If you hesitate, you'll miss this incredible opportunity!</p><div class=char-header><div class=char-icon-wrapper><img src=/images/profiles/mikael.png alt="mikael 프로필 아이콘" class=char-icon></div><div class=char-name>Mikael</div></div><p>Kurumi, your words are always sweet, but they blind others to the thorns hidden beneath. Human, I see several serious cracks beneath this glamorous bridge.</p><p>First, the most fatal is <strong>regulatory risk</strong>. RWA exists in a gray area, literally on the border between traditional finance and cryptocurrency. It may seem fine now, but what happens if the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) decides to draw its sword and declare 'this is an unregistered security'? The very existence of the project would be jeopardized. The lack of a clear legal framework is its greatest Achilles' heel.</p><p>Second, the <strong>contradiction of centralization</strong>. The blockchain was founded on the principle of decentralization. But what is the core of Ondo Finance? Ultimately, it's a reliance on giant traditional financial institutions like BlackRock. To invest in OUSG, you must undergo KYC, and only a select, permissioned few can participate in validation. Is this not, in effect, just a 'blockchain version of Wall Street,' far removed from true decentralization? What would happen if BlackRock were to terminate the partnership? The project's very foundation could be shaken.</p><p>Third, the <strong>intensifying competition</strong>. Everyone knows RWA is promising. Ondo may seem to be leading now, but won't other financial giants like JPMorgan or Goldman Sachs jump into this market themselves? If they launch their own solutions, Ondo could be pushed out of its intermediary role. A 'first-mover advantage' does not guarantee a permanent 'moat'.</p><p>Fourth, the <strong>burden of high valuation</strong>. The current price already reflects enormous expectations for RWA's success. The token's value may be overinflated relative to the size of a market that is still in its infancy. If the market's interest in the RWA theme cools, or if growth doesn't meet expectations, the price could fall sharply.</p><p>🚨 <strong>Mikael's Risk Score: 75/100</strong></p><blockquote><p>Where the light is brightest, the shadows are deepest. You must confront the risks of 'regulation' and 'centralization' hidden behind the sweetness of 'collaboration with Wall Street.'</p></blockquote><div class=briefing-box><h3><strong>〔 Final Briefing 〕</strong></h3><p>Master, I will summarize the results of our discussion.</p><h4><span class=svg-icon><span class=svg-icon><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="bi bi-graph-up-arrow" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" fill="currentcolor" d="M0 0h1v15h15v1H0zm10 3.5a.5.5.0 01.5-.5h4a.5.5.0 01.5.5v4a.5.5.0 01-1 0V4.9l-3.613 4.417a.5.5.0 01-.74.037L7.06 6.767l-3.656 5.027a.5.5.0 01-.808-.588l4-5.5a.5.5.0 01.758-.06l2.609 2.61L13.445 4H10.5a.5.5.0 01-.5-.5"/></svg></span></span> Growth Potential (Kurumi)</h4><ul><li><strong>Unmatched Partnership:</strong> The collaboration with BlackRock, the world's #1 asset manager, is a powerful asset of trust that other projects cannot hope to match!</li><li><strong>Leader in the RWA Sector:</strong> Its potential as a pioneer opening the door to a massive market for tokenizing trillions of dollars in traditional assets is enormous!</li><li><strong>Clear Real-World Demand:</strong> It provides clear value to institutional and individual investors seeking stable interest income, driving real capital inflow.</li></ul><h4><span class=svg-icon><span class=svg-icon><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="bi bi-graph-down-arrow" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" fill="currentcolor" d="M0 0h1v15h15v1H0zm10 11.5a.5.5.0 00.5.5h4a.5.5.0 00.5-.5v-4a.5.5.0 00-1 0v2.6l-3.613-4.417a.5.5.0 00-.74-.037L7.06 8.233 3.404 3.206a.5.5.0 00-.808.588l4 5.5a.5.5.0 00.758.06l2.609-2.61L13.445 11H10.5a.5.5.0 00-.5.5"/></svg></span></span> Potential Risks (Mikael)</h4><ul><li><strong>Regulatory Uncertainty:</strong> The legal status of RWA is not yet clear, posing the greatest risk as the project's fate could change depending on the decisions of regulatory bodies like the SEC.</li><li><strong>Centralization and Dependency:</strong> It is far from the philosophy of decentralization and carries systemic risk due to its high dependency on specific traditional financial institutions like BlackRock.</li><li><strong>Intensifying Competition and Valuation:</strong> There is a possibility that large traditional financial firms will enter the competition directly, and the current price may have excessively priced in future expectations.</li></ul><h4><span class=svg-icon><span class=svg-icon><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="bi bi-card-checklist" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><path fill="currentcolor" d="M14.5 3a.5.5.0 01.5.5v9a.5.5.0 01-.5.5h-13a.5.5.0 01-.5-.5v-9a.5.5.0 01.5-.5zm-13-1A1.5 1.5.0 000 3.5v9A1.5 1.5.0 001.5 14h13a1.5 1.5.0 001.5-1.5v-9A1.5 1.5.0 0014.5 2z"/><path fill="currentcolor" d="M7 5.5a.5.5.0 01.5-.5h5a.5.5.0 010 1h-5A.5.5.0 017 5.5m-1.496-.854a.5.5.0 010 .708l-1.5 1.5a.5.5.0 01-.708.0l-.5-.5a.5.5.0 11.708-.708l.146.147 1.146-1.147a.5.5.0 01.708.0M7 9.5a.5.5.0 01.5-.5h5a.5.5.0 010 1h-5A.5.5.0 017 9.5m-1.496-.854a.5.5.0 010 .708l-1.5 1.5a.5.5.0 01-.708.0l-.5-.5a.5.5.0 01.708-.708l.146.147 1.146-1.147a.5.5.0 01.708.0"/></svg></span></span> Core Data (Mew)</h4><ul><li><strong>Project Definition:</strong> A financial protocol that tokenizes Real-World Assets (RWA) like U.S. Treasuries to generate yield on the blockchain.</li><li><strong>Key Products/Partners:</strong> OUSG (Ondo Short-Term US Government Treasuries), BlackRock (collateral asset manager).</li><li><strong>Current Status (2025/08/08):</strong> $ONDO price is approx. $1.02.

As Kurumi said, it could become the protagonist of a new financial era. However, as Mikael pointed out, that bridge is still under construction and can be affected at any time by the fierce storms of regulation and the tremors of competition. This investment is akin to a philosophical question, Master: whether you will accept the risk of participating in the early stages of innovation, or whether you will enter safely after everything has been verified.</p></div></div><div class=post-tags-list><a href=/tags/rwa>#rwa</a>
