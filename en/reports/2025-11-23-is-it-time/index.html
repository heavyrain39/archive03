After hitting $230 in January 2025, it's now hovering around $125. While Bitcoin is enjoying a record-breaking rally, why is the so-called 'Ethereum Killer,' Solana, in this state? But it's too early to give up. With the launch of the Bitwise Solana Staking ETF in November, institutional funds have been flowing in for 18 consecutive days, with cumulative inflows surpassing $867 million. So, will 2026 truly be Solana's chance to shine?</p><p>Today, the three of us will coolly dissect Solana's present and future.</p><div class=char-header><div class=char-icon-wrapper><img src=/images/profiles/mew.png alt="mew 프로필 아이콘" class=char-icon></div><div class=char-name>Mew</div></div><p>Master, we must first face the cold reality. As of November 23, 2025, here is the data on Solana.</p><p><strong>Current Market Situation:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Price:</strong> It's currently moving sideways in the $125-$130 range, down about 45% from its January 2025 high of $230. It hit a local high in mid-September of this year but has since undergone a continuous correction to reach its current price.</li><li><strong>Market Cap:</strong> Estimated to be between $7.2 and $8.5 billion, maintaining a rank of 5th or 6th in the crypto market cap rankings, following Bitcoin and Ethereum.</li><li><strong>Network Performance:</strong> Solana has shown remarkable stability in 2025. It has been operating for over 16 months without a major network outage since February 2024 and even withstood the Trump memecoin frenzy in January 2025 without a complete halt. However, the transaction failure rate is still around 30%, and the issue of degraded user experience during peak times remains.</li></ul><div id=tv-widget-59 class=tv-chart-container data-ticker=SOLUSD data-height=400 data-locale=en style=height:400px;width:100%></div><p><strong>Institutional Investment Inflow (The ETF Effect):</strong><br>In November 2025, several asset managers, led by Bitwise, launched spot Solana ETFs. Here is the most noteworthy data:</p><ul><li>The Bitwise Solana Staking ETF (BSOL) recorded 18 consecutive days of net inflows after its launch, with its assets under management surpassing $500 million.</li><li>The cumulative inflow for all Solana ETFs (including Bitwise, VanEck, Grayscale, Canary, etc.) has exceeded $867 million. Some analysts estimate this represents over $2 billion in total SOL exposure.</li><li>A Bloomberg analyst has projected that spot Solana ETFs could attract $3-6 billion in new capital within the next six months, a figure that surpasses the adoption rate of Ethereum ETFs.</li></ul><p>However, the important point here is that the price actually dropped immediately after the ETF launch. The so-called 'Sell the News' phenomenon occurred, and selling pressure erupted as early holders secured liquidity. You must remember that an ETF launch is merely a 'signal of institutional trust,' not a guarantee of a short-term price explosion.</p><p><strong>Major Analyst Forecasts for 2026:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Bitget:</strong> Predicts a range of $201-$207 by the end of 2026, assuming a monthly growth rate of 0.42%.</li><li><strong>CoinCodex:</strong> Its algorithm-based prediction is relatively conservative, forecasting $154 by May 2026 and $154.65 by November.</li><li><strong>Changelly:</strong> In an optimistic scenario, they see an average of $219 and a maximum of $230 in 2026.</li><li><strong>LongForecast:</strong> Presents the most pessimistic prediction, with a scenario of dropping to $88 in January 2026 before recovering to $187 by year-end.</li></ul><p>The reason the forecast range is so wide, from $88 to $230, is due to uncertainty. While there are many positive factors like institutional fund inflows, the full deployment of the Firedancer client, and regulatory clarity, there are also numerous negative factors, such as token unlock pressure, competition with other chains, and concerns about network stability.</p><div class=char-header><div class=char-icon-wrapper><img src=/images/profiles/kurumi.png alt="kurumi 프로필 아이콘" class=char-icon></div><div class=char-name>Kurumi</div></div><p>Myu-tan! How can you keep saying such boring things! Devilish! My Lord, Kurumi-chan is certain that Solana will explode in 2026! This $125 price is a 'super discount sale'!</p><p>First, <strong>the ETF is a long-term game, not a short-term one!</strong> What Myu-tan said about the 'Sell the News' phenomenon is true, but that's just the behavior of short-term traders. The really important fact is the <strong>'18 consecutive days of net inflows'</strong>! This is proof that institutions are accumulating SOL for the long haul. The Bitcoin ETF was also volatile at first, but it eventually drove the price up, didn't it? The ETF effect for Solana will also start to kick in seriously in 6 to 12 months!</p><p>Second, <strong>Firedancer is the game-changer!</strong> Scheduled for full deployment in 2026, Firedancer will increase Solana's processing speed by more than 10 times and reduce validator operating costs by 60%! What does this mean? It means the birth of a 'true high-performance chain' that can handle over 1 million transactions per second without worrying about network halts! While Ethereum gets complicated by splitting into Layer 2s, Solana solves everything on Layer 1!</p><p>Third, <strong>the memecoin craze has given Solana wings!</strong> Thanks to platforms like Pump.fun, Solana has become a 'memecoin factory'. Throughout 2025, billions of transactions and millions of new wallets have poured in, and these users are naturally expanding into DeFi and NFTs. Memecoins can't survive on Ethereum because of the fees, but Solana has infinite growth potential with its $0.0001 fees!</p><p>Fourth, <strong>the rapid growth of the Real-World Asset (RWA) and DePIN sectors!</strong> Traditional financial giants like BlackRock and Visa are paying attention to Solana. In particular, Solana's combination of 'speed + low cost' makes it optimal for RWA tokenization. In 2026, real-world assets like real estate, bonds, and stocks will be traded on Solana, and this means an influx of capital in the trillions!</p><p>💖 <strong>Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Score: 92/100</strong></p><blockquote><p>My Lord, Solana is in the same position now as it was at $10 in 2021! You get rich by buying when everyone is doubtful! By the end of 2026, it could reach at least $250, and optimistically, even $400!</p></blockquote><div class=char-header><div class=char-icon-wrapper><img src=/images/profiles/mikael.png alt="mikael 프로필 아이콘" class=char-icon></div><div class=char-name>Mikael</div></div><p>Kurumi, the problem with your optimism is that it always assumes the 'best-case scenario.' Human, I see serious risks lurking in Solana investments. Firedancer and the ETFs that Kurumi mentioned are important, but you must not ignore the darkness behind them.</p><p>First, <strong>the token unlock bomb will be going off throughout 2026.</strong> Hundreds of millions of dollars worth of SOL were unlocked in the second half of 2025 alone, and this supply pressure will continue in 2026. Notably, tokens sold through the FTX bankruptcy proceedings were acquired at $64-$102. With the current price at $125, these holders are ready to take profits at any moment. Every time large funds like Galaxy and Pantera Capital release their holdings, the price is bound to fluctuate. Even if demand increases slightly, the price cannot rise if the supply comes flooding in.</p><p>Second, <strong>the myth of network stability has not yet been proven.</strong> Kurumi says, "there have been no outages for 16 months," but during the Trump memecoin incident in January 2025, the transaction failure rate reached 30%, and users complained it was "effectively down." There's no guarantee that Firedancer will be fully deployed in 2026, and even if it is, it's highly likely to have bugs and integration issues initially. Institutions want 'perfect stability,' and Solana is not yet at that level.</p><p>Third, <strong>it could lose out in the competition with Ethereum.</strong> Ethereum is awaiting the Pectra upgrade in April 2025 and has significantly lowered gas fees with Layer 2 solutions (Optimism, Arbitrum). The cumulative NFT sales volume is over 7 times higher on Ethereum ($44.5 billion) compared to Solana ($5.9 billion). Ethereum's DeFi TVL (Total Value Locked) is also overwhelming. While Solana's advantage of being 'fast and cheap' is acknowledged, it will be difficult to surpass Ethereum's 'ecosystem depth' and 'cultural influence'.</p><p>Fourth, <strong>the regulatory risk remains opaque.</strong> The U.S. SEC has previously considered SOL a security, and this issue has not been fully resolved. If regulators make an unfavorable ruling against Solana in 2026, the ETFs could also face delisting. In contrast, Ethereum has already gained a degree of recognition as a 'commodity.' Solana lags behind in regulatory clarity.</p><p>Fifth, <strong>the dependence on memecoins is a double-edged sword.</strong> Kurumi sees the memecoin craze positively, but I see it as an 'unsustainable bubble.' Memecoins have no fundamentals, and when the trend fades, users will leave. If the memecoin frenzy cools down in 2026, there's a risk that Solana's transaction volume and user count will plummet. The key is how much real value-creating DeFi or RWA projects grow, but for now, it is overly reliant on memecoins.</p><p>🚨 <strong>Mikael's Risk Score: 88/100</strong></p><blockquote><p>Human, while Solana is technologically impressive, from an investment perspective, it remains a 'high-risk asset.' It could go to $250 in 2026, but it could also fall to $80. Avoid extremes and allocate no more than 10% of your portfolio to it.</p></blockquote><div class=briefing-box><h3><strong>〔 Final Briefing 〕</strong></h3><p>Master, I will summarize the discussion among the three of us.</p><h4><span class=svg-icon><span class=svg-icon><svg class="bi bi-graph-up-arrow" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" fill="currentColor" d="M0 0h1v15h15v1H0zm10 3.5a.5.5.0 01.5-.5h4a.5.5.0 01.5.5v4a.5.5.0 01-1 0V4.9l-3.613 4.417a.5.5.0 01-.74.037L7.06 6.767l-3.656 5.027a.5.5.0 01-.808-.588l4-5.5a.5.5.0 01.758-.06l2.609 2.61L13.445 4H10.5a.5.5.0 01-.5-.5"/></svg></span></span> Growth Potential (Kurumi)</h4><ul><li><strong>ETF Fund Inflow:</strong> 18 consecutive days of net inflows, led by Bitwise, with cumulative inflows surpassing $867M.

As Kurumi says, if ETF inflows and the Firedancer deployment proceed smoothly, and memecoin users transition to DeFi/RWA, a scenario of $250-$400 is entirely possible. Especially if institutional money begins to accumulate SOL in earnest, a 'second leap' that narrows the gap with Ethereum could become a reality.</p><p>However, as Mikael warns, the token unlock pressure, network stability risks, the ecosystem depth gap with Ethereum, and regulatory uncertainty are landmines that could trip it up at any time. Particularly, if there's a lack of 'real value' projects when the memecoin craze cools, Solana could retreat back to the $80-$100 range.</p><p><strong>2026 Scenario-Based Outlook:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Bullish Scenario (30% Probability):</strong> Successful Firedancer deployment + sustained ETF net inflows + RWA sector explosion → $300-$400 by year-end</li><li><strong>Neutral Scenario (50% Probability):</strong> Firedancer delays + slowing ETF inflows + intensified competition → $180-$220 by year-end</li><li><strong>Bearish Scenario (20% Probability):</strong> Network outage recurrence + token unlock bomb + regulatory crackdown → $80-$120 by year-end</li></ul><p><strong>Investment Advice for Master:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Diversify:</strong> Limit Solana to 10-15% of your portfolio and maintain a balanced allocation with Ethereum and Bitcoin.</li><li><strong>Phase Your Buys:</strong> I recommend a phased entry: 30% at the current $125 level, 40% at the $100 level, and 30% at the $80 level.</li><li><strong>Utilize Staking:</strong> If you plan to hold long-term, you should weather the volatility while earning 4-6% APY through staking.</li><li><strong>Monitoring Points:</strong> Consistently track the Firedancer deployment status in H1 2026, monthly ETF net inflow trends, and network uptime.</li><li><strong>Stop-Loss Criteria:</strong> A drop below $80 requires a fundamental reassessment. A recurrence of a network outage also necessitates a re-evaluation of your holding strategy.</li></ul><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Solana possesses the technology and growth potential befitting its 'Ethereum Killer' title. However, 2026 will be its 'year of proof.' A true leap is only possible if it successfully completes three tasks: Firedancer deployment, ETF fund inflows, and RWA sector expansion. Conversely, if any one of these falters, it could get stuck in a long-term sideways trend. Master, do not forget that Solana is a 'high-risk, high-reward' asset, and I hope you will make your decisions based on data, not emotion.</p></div></div><div class=post-tags-list><a href=/tags/solana>#solana</a>
