SK Hynix, in particular, grabbed investors' attention by hitting an intraday all-time high of 679,000 won on the first trading day of the new year. Securities firms are even making bold predictions, suggesting operating profits could reach 80 to 100 trillion won in 2026.</p><p>Today, we will thoroughly analyze this hot topic: <strong>SK Hynix's 2026 investment outlook</strong>. With HBM4 mass production, surging commodity DRAM prices, and NAND turning profitable, all indicators point to record-breaking performance. But is the current stock price appropriate? How much room is there for further upside? Let's dissect it!</p><div class=char-header><div class=char-icon-wrapper><img src=/images/profiles/mew.png alt="mew 프로필 아이콘" class=char-icon></div><div class=char-name>Mew</div></div><p>Master, I will first objectively brief you on SK Hynix's current situation. As of January 3, 2026, SK Hynix is trading at 677,000 won, with a market capitalization of approximately 450 trillion won. Over the past year, the stock price has surged by an astonishing 246%, and its 52-week high is 679,000 won.</p><ul><li><strong>Securities Firm Consensus:</strong> Out of 35 analysts, 35 have issued a 'buy' rating, with only 1 'sell' rating. The average 12-month target price is 712,000 won, with the highest target at 900,000 won and the lowest at 255,000 won. Major securities firms have raised their targets, including Kiwoom Securities to 730,000 won, Daishin Securities to 840,000 won, and NH Investment & Securities to 880,000 won.</li><br><li><strong>2025 Performance:</strong> As of Q3, revenue reached 24.4 trillion won and operating profit 11.4 trillion won, achieving the highest quarterly performance since its establishment. The operating profit margin is a phenomenal 47%. The estimated full-year operating profit for 2025 is approximately 45 trillion won.</li><br><li><strong>2026 Performance Outlook:</strong> Securities firms are forecasting operating profits for 2026 to be between 80 to 105 trillion won. Forecasts from Kiwoom Securities (80 trillion won), Daishin Securities (100 trillion won), and NH Investment & Securities (105 trillion won) continue to be revised upwards. This represents an explosive growth of 78-133% year-on-year.</li><br><li><strong>HBM Market Dominance:</strong> As of 2025, SK Hynix holds an overwhelming lead in the HBM market share at 62-64%, significantly ahead of Samsung Electronics (15-17%) and Micron (21%). The 2026 production volume is already sold out, and supply shortages are expected to persist until 2027.</li><br><li><strong>HBM4 Mass Production:</strong> In September 2025, SK Hynix completed HBM4 development globally first and established a mass production system. Full-scale shipments are set to begin in February 2026, with HBM4 shipments projected to grow by 54% year-on-year to 19 billion gigabits. HBM4 offers double the bandwidth and 40% improved power efficiency compared to HBM3E.</li><br><li><strong>Commodity DRAM Supercycle:</strong> Since late 2025, commodity DRAM prices have been surging. The average price of PC DDR4 8Gb 1Gx8 jumped by 37% in November alone, and an additional 37% quarter-over-quarter increase is expected in Q1 2026. This is projected to boost commodity DRAM's operating profit margin from 50% in Q3 to 70% in Q1.</li><br><li><strong>NAND Turnaround to Profit:</strong> The NAND division, previously considered a weakness, is also expected to see its operating profit significantly expand to 5 trillion won in 2026, turning profitable due to increased eSSD demand and rising prices. This marks a 400% growth year-on-year.</li><br><li><strong>Key Risk Factors:</strong> Some HBM4 12-layer quality issues have been raised but are expected to be resolved within Q1. There are also concerns about a slowdown in PC and smartphone demand due to soaring DRAM prices. However, in the short term, the momentum for improved performance is expected to outweigh these concerns.</li></ul><p>That concludes the data briefing. Now it's Kurumi's turn to argue why SK Hynix should be bought now.</p><div class=char-header><div class=char-icon-wrapper><img src=/images/profiles/kurumi.png alt="kurumi 프로필 아이콘" class=char-icon></div><div class=char-name>Kurumi</div></div><p>My Lord! This is an unmissable, huge opportunity, Devilish! Even just Myu-tan's data is jaw-dropping! 2026 will be SK Hynix's golden age, Devilish!</p><p><strong>First, breaching 100 trillion won in operating profit will become a reality, Devilish!</strong> There's a very high possibility it will be the first Korean company in history to surpass 100 trillion won in operating profit, Devilish! Daishin Securities is predicting a whopping 100 trillion won, and NH Investment & Securities up to 105 trillion won, Devilish! This is more than double 2025's 45 trillion won, Devilish. The stock price is 670,000 won? If operating profit doubles, the stock price has the potential to rise by that much too, Devilish!</p><p><strong>Second, HBM4 is a game-changer, Devilish!</strong> SK Hynix has completed HBM4 development first in the world and will begin mass production in February 2026, Devilish! While competitors like Samsung Electronics are starting at the same time, SK Hynix has already secured HBM4 supply contracts with NVIDIA, OpenAI, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon, Devilish! HBM4 sells at a price up to 58% higher than HBM3E, which means profit margins will explode, Devilish!</p><p><strong>Third, commodity DRAM has unexpectedly entered a supercycle, Devilish!</strong> We originally thought only HBM would sell well, but commodity DRAM prices are also skyrocketing, Devilish! A 37% increase in just one month—that's almost Bitcoin-level growth, Devilish! The reason is simple, Devilish. As SK Hynix and Samsung Electronics go all-in on HBM production, there's a shortage of commodity DRAM production lines, leading to a price surge due to supply shortages, Devilish. This is an unexpected 'bonus jackpot,' Devilish!</p><p><strong>Fourth, 2026 production volume is already sold out, Devilish!</strong> As Myu-tan said, SK Hynix has already sold out its entire memory semiconductor production volume for 2026, Devilish! What does this mean, Devilish? It means even running at full capacity throughout 2026, they can't meet all the demand, Devilish! Holding pricing power in a seller's market directly leads to maximized profit margins, Devilish!</p><p><strong>Fifth, NAND profits are exploding too, Devilish!</strong> The NAND sector, previously considered SK Hynix's weakness, is finally spreading its wings, Devilish! With Solidyne's server QLC technology, competitiveness is secured, and NAND division operating profit is expected to reach 5 trillion won in 2026, growing by 400% year-on-year, Devilish! Now, SK Hynix will be the strongest in DRAM, HBM, and NAND, Devilish!</p><p><strong>Sixth, securities firms are aggressively raising their target prices, Devilish!</strong> Kiwoom Securities 730,000 won, Daishin Securities 840,000 won, NH Investment & Securities 880,000 won, and KB Securities even said 1,150,000 won is possible if the memory boom continues until 2028, Devilish! From the current price of 677,000 won to 1,150,000 won means almost 70% upside potential, Devilish!</p><p>💖 <strong>Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Score: 98/100</strong></p><blockquote><p>My Lord, SK Hynix will be the absolute strongest in the Korean stock market in 2026, Devilish! This is a historic moment where supercycles in HBM4, commodity DRAM, and NAND are all overlapping, Devilish! You'll regret it for life if you don't buy now, Devilish!</p></blockquote><div class=char-header><div class=char-icon-wrapper><img src=/images/profiles/mikael.png alt="mikael 프로필 아이콘" class=char-icon></div><div class=char-name>Mikael</div></div><p>Kurumi, your endless optimism is truly perilous. Human, you could be severely disappointed if you only listen to Kurumi. I want to point out several obvious risks.</p><p><strong>First, the current stock price already reflects a perfect future.</strong> SK Hynix's current stock price of 677,000 won is near an all-time high. Even if we assume an operating profit of 100 trillion won for 2026, the PER is approximately 13.3x. At first glance, it may seem undervalued, but this figure does not account for depreciation. SK Hynix has a massive burden of depreciation due to huge capital expenditures. In terms of EBITDA, Samsung Electronics still leads, which is why Samsung Electronics' PER is 24.9x, much higher than SK Hynix's.</p><p><strong>Second, HBM4 quality issues could be more serious than anticipated.</strong> Kurumi said they could be resolved within Q1, but semiconductor quality verification involves many unpredictable variables. HBM4 has a complex structure with 12-16 layers stacked and logic functions in the base die, so if yield issues arise, mass production schedules could be delayed. We must remember that Samsung Electronics struggled to pass NVIDIA's qualification test for HBM3E.</p><p><strong>Third, the surge in commodity DRAM prices is a double-edged sword.</strong> A 37% jump in one month could be an abnormal bubble. If prices rise too much, PC and smartphone manufacturers will reduce production or postpone new product launches. Indeed, Dell increased product prices by 15-20%, and HP plans to raise prices by up to 30% from H2 2026. This could lead to a slump in the PC market and ultimately a backlash of sharply declining DRAM demand.</p><p><strong>Fourth, 2026 production volume being sold out implies a risk for 2027.</strong> While 2026 volume being sold out is good news, from 2027 onwards, Samsung Electronics' Pyeongtaek P4, Micron's new US fabs, and SK Hynix's Yongin cluster will become fully operational, potentially leading to an oversupply. We must not forget the painful memory of DRAM prices plummeting by 47% in 2019 after the 2018 memory supercycle. History repeats itself.</p><p><strong>Fifth, competition with Samsung Electronics is intensifying.</strong> Samsung Electronics is also starting HBM4 mass production in February 2026 and recently received positive evaluations for HBM4 samples from NVIDIA. Furthermore, Samsung Electronics claims to have achieved higher integration and performance by applying 1c nanometer process and 4 nanometer foundry process. If Samsung Electronics captures HBM market share, SK Hynix's dominant position could be shaken.</p><p><strong>Sixth, geopolitical risks remain.</strong> SK Hynix has a factory in Wuxi, China, and US semiconductor export regulations against China continue to strengthen. From 2026, the entry of US-made semiconductor equipment into Chinese factories will shift to an individual approval system, which is a variable that could lead to production disruptions.</p><p><strong>Seventh, it's at a disadvantage in valuation comparison.</strong> Kurumi mentioned it could reach 1,150,000 won, but this is an extreme scenario applying Micron's valuation to SK Hynix. Realistically, SK Hynix is bound to receive a lower valuation than Micron due to its high depreciation burden and cyclical volatility. KB Securities' 1,150,000 won forecast also comes with the precondition of a 'bull market,' which should not be overlooked.</p><p>🚨 <strong>Mikael's Risk Score: 68/100</strong></p><blockquote><p>Human, SK Hynix certainly has a high probability of achieving its best performance in 2026. However, the current stock price already largely reflects these expectations, and for further upside, performance must continue to exceed consensus. If the Q1 earnings announcement falls short of expectations, the stock price could drop sharply. Limit your portfolio to under 30% and diversify the rest into other investments.</p></blockquote><div class=char-header><div class=char-icon-wrapper><img src=/images/profiles/kurumi.png alt="kurumi 프로필 아이콘" class=char-icon></div><div class=char-name>Kurumi</div></div><p>Mika-pi! If you only worry like that, when will you ever make money, Devilish! Quality issues? SK Hynix achieved an 80% yield in HBM3E and is a proven company, Devilish! Samsung Electronics competition? SK Hynix has already secured 63% of NVIDIA's volume and has formed a 'one team' with TSMC, leading in base die technology, Devilish!</p><p>Mika-pi's risk of oversupply in 2027 is still far off, Devilish! We only need to profit properly for the year 2026, Devilish! And AI infrastructure investment is expected to increase by 20% annually until at least 2028, Devilish! Short-term adjustments may occur, but the long-term trend is upward, Devilish!</p><div class=char-header><div class=char-icon-wrapper><img src=/images/profiles/mew.png alt="mew 프로필 아이콘" class=char-icon></div><div class=char-name>Mew</div></div><p>Kurumi and Mikael both have valid points. But what's most important for Master is 'when to buy' and 'how much to buy'. I will objectively analyze SK Hynix's investment timing and position size at the current juncture.</p><p><strong>First, there are signs of short-term overheating.</strong> The current stock price has broken its 52-week high, and the RSI (Relative Strength Index) is approaching the overbought zone. Expectations are extremely high ahead of the Q4 earnings announcement on January 21. If earnings fall short of consensus or guidance disappoints, a short-term correction is inevitable.</p><p><strong>Second, the mid-to-long-term fundamentals remain strong.</strong> Securities firms continue to raise their target prices because earnings forecasts have consistently been conservative. Kiwoom Securities expects Q1 2026 operating profit to be 17.3 trillion won, which is 16% higher than the market consensus of 14.9 trillion won. If earnings continue to exceed expectations in this manner, the stock price will inevitably steadily climb towards its target price.</p><p><strong>Third, the key variable is the success of HBM4 mass production.</strong> Full-scale HBM4 shipments are set to begin in February 2026, with initial yield rates and securing NVIDIA volume being critical. If HBM4 mass production proceeds as planned, an earnings explosion is expected from Q2, and that will be the true starting point for stock price appreciation.</p><p><strong>Fourth, position size should be adjusted according to investment propensity.</strong> Aggressive investors could allocate up to 30-40% of their portfolio, but conservative investors should limit it to under 20% and diversify the rest into Samsung Electronics or bonds. As Mikael pointed out, semiconductors are a cyclical industry, and the possibility of increased volatility after 2027 should always be kept in mind.</p><p><strong>Mew's Recommendation: 85/100</strong></p><blockquote><p>Master, SK Hynix is undoubtedly one of the best investment opportunities in 2026. However, as the current stock price is already at a high level, a staggered buying strategy is more advantageous than a lump-sum purchase. It would be a wise choice to make additional purchases if a short-term correction occurs after the January 21 earnings announcement.</p></blockquote><div class=char-header><div class=char-icon-wrapper><img src=/images/profiles/mikael.png alt="mikael 프로필 아이콘" class=char-icon></div><div class=char-name>Mikael</div></div><p>Mew's analysis is the most realistic. I also acknowledge that SK Hynix's fundamentals are strong. But Human, timing is crucial. Do not pour all your money in right now; instead, prepare for the following three scenarios.</p><ul><li><strong>Scenario 1 (50% probability):</strong> If Q1 earnings exceed consensus and HBM4 mass production is smooth, the stock price could rise to 750,000-800,000 won. In this case, maintain your current holdings but be cautious about additional purchases.</li><li><strong>Scenario 2 (30% probability):</strong> If Q1 earnings are good but guidance falls short of expectations due to HBM4 quality issues or stagnation in commodity DRAM prices, the stock price could correct to 600,000-650,000 won. This would be the true buying opportunity.</li><li><strong>Scenario 3 (20% probability):</strong> If unexpected negative news (China regulations, Samsung Electronics catching up, NVIDIA demand slowdown) emerges, the stock price could plummet below 550,000 won. In this case, clearly set your stop-loss limit.</li></ul><p>I recommend formulating a buying strategy based on the January 21 earnings announcement. For now, observing market reactions is the safest approach.</p><div class=briefing-box><h3><strong>〔 Final Briefing 〕</strong></h3><p>Master, I will summarize the results of our discussion.</p><h4><span class=svg-icon><span class=svg-icon><svg class="bi bi-graph-up-arrow" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" fill="currentColor" d="M0 0h1v15h15v1H0zm10 3.5a.5.5.0 01.5-.5h4a.5.5.0 01.5.5v4a.5.5.0 01-1 0V4.9l-3.613 4.417a.5.5.0 01-.74.037L7.06 6.767l-3.656 5.027a.5.5.0 01-.808-.588l4-5.5a.5.5.0 01.758-.06l2.609 2.61L13.445 4H10.5a.5.5.0 01-.5-.5"/></svg></span></span> Growth Potential (Kurumi)</h4><ul><li><strong>Potential to Surpass 100 Trillion Won in Operating Profit:</strong> Securities firms forecast 2026 operating profits of 80-105 trillion won, making 100 trillion won the first time for a Korean company, a realistic possibility, Devilish!</li><li><strong>World's First HBM4 Mass Production:</strong> Full-scale HBM4 shipments begin in February 2026, expected to sell for up to 58% higher than HBM3E, maximizing profit margins, Devilish!</li><li><strong>Commodity DRAM Supercycle:</strong> Prices surging by 37% in one month are boosting DRAM operating profit margins to 70% level, Devilish!</li><li><strong>Securities Firms Raising Target Prices:</strong> Major securities firms have raised targets to 730,000-880,000 won, with some even forecasting 1,150,000 won in a bull market, Devilish!</li></ul><h4><span class=svg-icon><span class=svg-icon><svg class="bi bi-graph-down-arrow" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" fill="currentColor" d="M0 0h1v15h15v1H0zm10 11.5a.5.5.0 00.5.5h4a.5.5.0 00.5-.5v-4a.5.5.0 00-1 0v2.6l-3.613-4.417a.5.5.0 00-.74-.037L7.06 8.233 3.404 3.206a.5.5.0 00-.808.588l4 5.5a.5.5.0 00.758.06l2.609-2.61L13.445 11H10.5a.5.5.0 00-.5.5"/></svg></span></span> Potential Risks (Mikael)</h4><ul><li><strong>Valuation Burden:</strong> The current stock price is at an all-time high and already reflects a perfect future; further upside may be limited considering depreciation burden.</li><li><strong>HBM4 Quality Risk:</strong> The complexity of 12-16 layer stacking increases the possibility of production delays if yield issues occur, and intensifying competition with Samsung Electronics is also a variable.</li><li><strong>DRAM Price Bubble Concern:</strong> A 37% surge is an abnormal level, and there's a possibility of backlash from slowing PC and smartphone demand.</li><li><strong>2027 Oversupply Risk:</strong> With new fabs from Samsung Electronics, Micron, and SK Hynix coming online, there's a possibility of oversupply from 2027.</li></ul><h4><span class=svg-icon><span class=svg-icon><svg class="bi bi-card-checklist" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><path fill="currentColor" d="M14.5 3a.5.5.0 01.5.5v9a.5.5.0 01-.5.5h-13a.5.5.0 01-.5-.5v-9a.5.5.0 01.5-.5zm-13-1A1.5 1.5.0 000 3.5v9A1.5 1.5.0 001.5 14h13a1.5 1.5.0 001.5-1.5v-9A1.5 1.5.0 0014.5 2z"/><path fill="currentColor" d="M7 5.5a.5.5.0 01.5-.5h5a.5.5.0 010 1h-5A.5.5.0 017 5.5m-1.496-.854a.5.5.0 010 .708l-1.5 1.5a.5.5.0 01-.708.0l-.5-.5a.5.5.0 11.708-.708l.146.147 1.146-1.147a.5.5.0 01.708.0M7 9.5a.5.5.0 01.5-.5h5a.5.5.0 010 1h-5A.5.5.0 017 9.5m-1.496-.854a.5.5.0 010 .708l-1.5 1.5a.5.5.0 01-.708.0l-.5-.5a.5.5.0 01.708-.708l.146.147 1.146-1.147a.5.5.0 01.708.0"/></svg></span></span> Key Data (Mew)</h4><ul><li><strong>Current Stock Price:</strong> 677,000 won (January 3, 2026), Market Cap approx. 450 trillion won</li><li><strong>Securities Firm Consensus:</strong> 35 'Buy' / Average Target Price 712,000 won</li><li><strong>2026 Performance Outlook:</strong> Operating Profit 80-105 trillion won (78-133% growth year-on-year)</li><li><strong>HBM Market Share:</strong> 62-64% (Overwhelming #1)</li><li><strong>Key Dates:</strong> Q4 Earnings Announcement January 21, HBM4 Full-scale Shipment February</li></ul><div class=final-conclusion><p>Master, the conclusion is clear. <strong>SK Hynix is undoubtedly one of the best investment opportunities in 2026, but the current stock price already reflects many expectations.</strong> A staggered buying strategy is wiser than a lump-sum purchase.
