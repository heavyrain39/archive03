Nvidia has surged over 50% year-to-date, and Microsoft and Google are pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into AI infrastructure. It is perfectly natural for Master to be wondering, "Which AI stocks should I buy?"</p><p>Individual stocks are highly volatile and carry significant risk. Therefore, today, the three of us will thoroughly dissect the <strong>TOP 3 AI ETFs that even beginners can safely approach</strong>. We will show you the smartest way to ride the AI trend with low-cost, diversified investment!</p><div class=char-header><div class=char-icon-wrapper><img src=/images/profiles/mew.png alt="mew 프로필 아이콘" class=char-icon></div><div class=char-name>Mew</div></div><p>Master, I will first brief you on the current status of the AI ETF market in 2025. This year, AI-related ETFs have recorded remarkable performance.</p><ul><li><strong>Overall Market Trend:</strong> As of November 14, 2025, the year-to-date returns of the top 5 AI ETFs reached an astonishing 30-50%. The Roundhill Generative AI Technology ETF recorded a 49.5% return, and semiconductor-focused ETFs also rose 38-45%.</li><li><strong>Institutional Capital Inflow:</strong> In 2025, 112 new products were launched in AI-related leveraged and general products alone, and AI-related products account for more than half of the leveraged market assets. This is evidence of explosive investor interest.</li><li><strong>Sector Performance:</strong> The technology sector ETF rose 23.9% year-to-date in 2025, significantly outperforming the overall S&P 500 rise. This trend is likely to continue as AI infrastructure investment persists.</li></ul><p>However, what is important here is <strong>which AI ETF to choose</strong>. For beginners, the three most important criteria are: <strong>(1) low operating costs, (2) high liquidity, and (3) a proven management company</strong>. You must select an ETF that satisfies these three criteria while effectively capturing AI growth.</p><p>The three ETFs we will focus on analyzing today are:</p><ul><li><strong>VanEck Semiconductor ETF ($SMH):</strong> Semiconductor-focused, centered on Nvidia and TSMC</li><li><strong>iShares Semiconductor ETF ($SOXX):</strong> Diversified semiconductor, emphasizing stability</li><li><strong>Invesco QQQ Trust ($QQQ):</strong> Tracks Nasdaq 100, comprehensive collection of AI big tech</li></ul><p>Now, it is Kurumi's and Mikael's turn to explain the pros and cons of each ETF.</p><div id=tv-widget-57 class=tv-chart-container data-ticker=SMH data-height=400 data-locale=en style=height:400px;width:100%></div><div class=char-header><div class=char-icon-wrapper><img src=/images/profiles/kurumi.png alt="kurumi 프로필 아이콘" class=char-icon></div><div class=char-name>Kurumi</div></div><p>Okay! Kurumi-chan will go first! My Lord, the hottest thing in AI investing is, without a doubt, <strong>semiconductors!</strong> And among them, Kurumi-chan's top recommendation is none other than the <strong>VanEck Semiconductor ETF ($SMH)</strong>!</p><p><strong>First, SMH is the strongest performer of 2025!</strong> As of November, its year-to-date return reached an astounding <strong>45.75%</strong>! That's more than 7% higher than SOXX, another semiconductor ETF, which returned 38.56%! Why is that? It's all thanks to its <strong>strategy of going all-in on the winners!</strong></p><p><strong>Second, Nvidia 21.3% + TSMC 13.8% = a dream combination!</strong> SMH's top 3 holdings (Nvidia, TSMC, Broadcom) account for 43.6% of the entire portfolio. What Kurumi-chan wants to say is this: <strong>"The winners of the AI era have already been decided!"</strong> Nvidia dominates 90% of the GPU market, and TSMC exclusively produces the world's most advanced semiconductors! As long as these two companies don't fail, SMH can only continue to rise!</p><p><strong>Third, the operating costs are reasonable too!</strong> An annual expense ratio of 0.35% is lower than SOXX's 0.46% and incredibly cheap compared to active funds. Moreover, its asset under management is $26.8 billion, meaning liquidity is top-notch. That means you can buy and sell whenever you want!</p><p><strong>Fourth, 2026 is the year of AI infrastructure!</strong> Bloomberg predicted that data center spending would reach $580 billion in 2025. All that money flows into Nvidia, TSMC, and Broadcom! Microsoft, Google, and Amazon will have to buy semiconductors like crazy if they don't want to fall behind in the AI race. SMH is the VIP seat at this party!</p><p>💖 <strong>Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Score: 95/100</strong></p><blockquote><p>My Lord, if you don't buy SMH now, you'll regret it in 2026! Semiconductors are the heart of AI, and SMH is the core of that heart!</p></blockquote><div class=char-header><div class=char-icon-wrapper><img src=/images/profiles/mikael.png alt="mikael 프로필 아이콘" class=char-icon></div><div class=char-name>Mikael</div></div><p>Kurumi, just a moment. Your extreme optimism is leading beginner investors off a cliff. Human, SMH is certainly attractive, but <strong>concentrated investment is a double-edged sword</strong>.</p><p><strong>First, allocating 43.6% to the top 3 holdings is dangerous.</strong> Even a slight miss in Nvidia's earnings announcement could cause the entire SMH to plummet by more than 10%. In fact, in November 2025, as investor anxiety increased before Nvidia's earnings release, SOXL, SMH, and SOXX all fell more than 10% from their year-to-date highs. Kurumi speaks of 'winner takes all,' but I want to warn against the risk of 'putting all your eggs in one basket.'</p><p><strong>Second, the valuation is too high.</strong> As of April 2025, SMH's price-to-earnings ratio significantly exceeds its historical average. This means the market has already factored in a 'perfect future' into the price. What if AI investment grows slower than expected, or competitors (AMD, Intel) snatch market share from Nvidia? An overvalued stock falls sharply even with small disappointments.</p><p><strong>Third, you are ignoring geopolitical risks.</strong> TSMC accounts for 13.8% of SMH, and TSMC is located in Taiwan. If US-China tensions escalate or tensions rise in the Taiwan Strait, TSMC's stock price could plummet, and SMH would take a direct hit. Kurumi is not considering such 'tail risks' at all.</p><p><strong>Fourth, volatility is poison for beginners.</strong> SMH's standard deviation (volatility) is 10.21%, a level difficult for beginner investors to handle. Daily fluctuations of 10-15% are common, and most beginners realize losses through panic selling during downturns. 'Holding for the long term' is easy to say but difficult to practice.</p><p>🚨 <strong>Mikael's Risk Score: 78/100</strong></p><blockquote><p>Human, SMH is a 'high-risk, high-return' product. It would be best to limit it to less than 20% of your portfolio and diversify the rest into more stable SOXX or QQQ.</p></blockquote><div class=char-header><div class=char-icon-wrapper><img src=/images/profiles/kurumi.png alt="kurumi 프로필 아이콘" class=char-icon></div><div class=char-name>Kurumi</div></div><p>Mika-pi! If you only worry, when will you ever make money? Devilish! In that case, Kurumi-chan will show you her second recommended product! It's the <strong>iShares Semiconductor ETF ($SOXX)</strong>!</p><p><strong>First, SOXX is the 'stable version of SMH'!</strong> It's composed of 35 stocks, making it more diversified than SMH (26 stocks). The top 5 holdings' weight is 38%, which is lower than SMH's 43.6%, reducing specific stock risk! You can avoid 'putting all your eggs in one basket' that Mika-pi worries about!</p><p><strong>Second, the dividend yield is higher!</strong> SOXX has a dividend yield of 0.63%, which is higher than SMH's 0.42%, and it pays quarterly, generating regular cash flow! You can maximize the compounding effect with stock price appreciation + dividend income!</p><p><strong>Third, the weighting of Broadcom and Qualcomm is high!</strong> SOXX has 10.1% in Broadcom and 5.4% in Qualcomm, giving it exposure to networking and mobile semiconductors as well! This means it's not just good at AI chips, but also has multiple future growth engines like 5G, IoT, and autonomous driving!</p><p><strong>Fourth, it has history and reliability!</strong> SOXX is an ETF that has been managed since 2001, with a proven track record of over 20 years! It's a survivor that has endured the dot-com bubble, the financial crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic! For beginners, this stability provides immense psychological comfort!</p><p>💖 <strong>Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Score: 88/100</strong></p><blockquote><p>My Lord, if SMH is too much, starting with SOXX is a wise choice too! It's an ETF that perfectly balances stability and growth!</p></blockquote><div class=char-header><div class=char-icon-wrapper><img src=/images/profiles/mikael.png alt="mikael 프로필 아이콘" class=char-icon></div><div class=char-name>Mikael</div></div><p>Hmm, Kurumi's analysis of SOXX is quite reasonable. However, it still has limitations.</p><p><strong>First, its returns are lower than SMH.</strong> Year-to-date in 2025, SOXX returned 38.56%, while SMH returned 45.75%. In the long term, SMH also outperforms SOXX. There's a trade-off that means sacrificing some returns if you choose stability.</p><p><strong>Second, the operating costs are higher.</strong> SOXX's 0.46% is 0.11 percentage points higher than SMH's 0.35%. This difference can accumulate to a non-negligible amount over long-term investment due to compounding.</p><p><strong>Third, it is still concentrated only in the semiconductor sector.</strong> The correlation coefficient between SOXX and SMH is 0.97, meaning they move in almost the same direction. This implies that if the semiconductor industry deteriorates, both will collapse together. If you truly want diversified investment, you need to include other sectors besides semiconductors.</p><p>🚨 <strong>Mikael's Risk Score: 72/100</strong></p><blockquote><p>SOXX is safer than SMH, but the fundamental risk of 'all-in on semiconductors' remains the same. Especially for beginners, broader diversification would be necessary.</p></blockquote><div class=char-header><div class=char-icon-wrapper><img src=/images/profiles/mew.png alt="mew 프로필 아이콘" class=char-icon></div><div class=char-name>Mew</div></div><p>Both of you are fixated on semiconductors. Master, I will tell you the best option for true beginners. It is the <strong>Invesco QQQ Trust ($QQQ)</strong>!</p><p><strong>First, QQQ encompasses the entire AI ecosystem.</strong> QQQ, which tracks the top Nasdaq 100 companies, includes all companies that create AI, utilize AI, and build AI infrastructure, such as Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, and Amazon. It includes not only semiconductors but also software, cloud, and e-commerce.</p><p><strong>Second, it is the safest for beginners.</strong> QQQ is composed of 100 stocks, minimizing individual stock risk. While the top 10 holdings account for about 50% of the total, it is a completely different dimension from SMH's 43.6% concentration in just 3 stocks. Its volatility is also lower than SMH and SOXX, making it easier for beginners to psychologically endure!</p><p><strong>Third, it has historically proven returns.</strong> QQQ's average annual return over the past 10 years exceeds 20%, and it has risen 19.86% year-to-date in 2025. Including dividend reinvestment, its 10-year return reached 450.71%. This is not simply due to the AI boom; it is proof that QQQ grows as long as technological innovation continues!</p><p><strong>Fourth, operating costs are low.</strong> An annual expense ratio of 0.20% is lower than SMH and SOXX and overwhelmingly cheap compared to active funds. Its asset under management is also enormous, so there are no liquidity concerns at all.</p><p><strong>Fifth, it is optimized for long-term investment.</strong> QQQ's dividend yield is low at 0.55%, but its dividend growth rate has averaged 10.18% over the past 10 years. This means the dividends received will increase over time. Furthermore, combining this with potential stock price appreciation, the long-term compounding effect is immense!</p><p><strong>Mew's Recommendation: 92/100</strong></p><blockquote><p>Master, QQQ is the 'all-around AI ETF for beginners'. While not as explosive as SMH, it has a golden ratio of stability and growth. If you are investing with a 10-year outlook, QQQ is the answer.</p></blockquote><div class=char-header><div class=char-icon-wrapper><img src=/images/profiles/kurumi.png alt="kurumi 프로필 아이콘" class=char-icon></div><div class=char-name>Kurumi</div></div><p>Myu-tan! QQQ rose 19.86% in 2025, but SMH was 45.75%! Devilish! The return difference is more than double! If My Lord wants to make a lot of money in the short term, QQQ is too slow!</p><div class=char-header><div class=char-icon-wrapper><img src=/images/profiles/mew.png alt="mew 프로필 아이콘" class=char-icon></div><div class=char-name>Mew</div></div><p>Kurumi focuses too much on short-term returns. In the 2022 bear market, QQQ had much higher defensiveness than SMH. For beginners, what is important is not 'high returns' but 'sustainable returns'. QQQ is an 'all-weather ETF' that rises moderately in bull markets and falls less in bear markets.</p><div class=char-header><div class=char-icon-wrapper><img src=/images/profiles/mikael.png alt="mikael 프로필 아이콘" class=char-icon></div><div class=char-name>Mikael</div></div><p>Mew's analysis is realistic. I also recommend QQQ or QQQM as a core portfolio for beginners. However, there are points to watch out for.</p><p><strong>First, interest rate risk.</strong> QQQ is growth-stock-centric, so if interest rates rise by 1%, the stock price could fall by approximately 15%. You need to continuously monitor the Fed's interest rate policy in 2026.</p><p><strong>Second, the dependency on the top 5 holdings is 35%.</strong> If Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Amazon all experience poor performance simultaneously, QQQ could also be hit. This means it's not perfectly diversified.</p><p><strong>Third, the valuation is high.</strong> Currently, QQQ's price-to-earnings ratio is higher than its historical average, so the possibility of a short-term correction cannot be ruled out.</p><p>🚨 <strong>Mikael's Risk Score: 62/100</strong></p><blockquote><p>QQQ is the safest of the three, but it is still technology-focused and vulnerable during economic downturns. Allocate 60-70% of your portfolio to QQQ, and diversify the rest into bonds or dividend stocks.</p></blockquote><div class=briefing-box><h3><strong>〔 Final Briefing 〕</strong></h3><p>Master, I will summarize the conclusions of the AI ETF TOP 3 introduced by the three of us.</p><h4><span class=svg-icon><span class=svg-icon><svg class="bi bi-graph-up-arrow" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" fill="currentColor" d="M0 0h1v15h15v1H0zm10 3.5a.5.5.0 01.5-.5h4a.5.5.0 01.5.5v4a.5.5.0 01-1 0V4.9l-3.613 4.417a.5.5.0 01-.74.037L7.06 6.767l-3.656 5.027a.5.5.0 01-.808-.588l4-5.5a.5.5.0 01.758-.06l2.609 2.61L13.445 4H10.5a.5.5.0 01-.5-.5"/></svg></span></span> Growth Potential (Kurumi)</h4><ul><li><strong>SMH: Icon of Explosive Growth</strong> - 45.75% return in 2025, direct beneficiary of the AI infrastructure boom through concentrated investment in Nvidia and TSMC!

It diversifies investment across the entire technology sector, not just AI, provides psychological stability with a track record proven over 20 years, and can maximize the long-term compounding effect with low costs (0.20%). If a salaried worker aims to hold it for over 10 years, QQQ is the answer.</p><p>However, as Kurumi said, if you want to directly target the <strong>AI infrastructure boom, SMH</strong> is the best. The 45.75% return in 2025 is not a coincidence but thanks to Nvidia and TSMC's market dominance. However, I only recommend it if you can withstand volatility and are confident in holding it for more than 5 years. Allocate only 20-30% of your portfolio to it, and diversify the rest with QQQ or bonds for safety.</p><p><strong>SOXX is a compromise</strong>. It's not as explosive as SMH nor as stable as QQQ, placing it in an ambiguous position, but if you want to invest in semiconductors while receiving quarterly dividends, it's not a bad choice. It is especially suitable for conservative investors who are burdened by SMH's concentration risk.</p><p><strong>Practical Strategy for Master:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Complete Beginner (less than 1 year investment experience):</strong> QQQ 100% → Prioritize stability, hold for 10 years</li><li><strong>Intermediate Investor (can withstand volatility):</strong> QQQ 60% + SMH 30% + Bonds 10% → Balance of offense and defense</li><li><strong>Aggressive Investor (can hold for 5+ years):</strong> SMH 50% + SOXX 30% + QQQ 20% → All-in on semiconductors, seeking maximum returns</li><li><strong>Dividend Preferencer:</strong> SOXX 60% + QQQ 40% → Quarterly dividends + growth potential</li></ul><p><strong>2026 Outlook:</strong> AI infrastructure investment is expected to continue until at least 2026. Bloomberg projected data center spending to exceed $600 billion, and Nvidia is expected to see explosive sales with its next-generation Blackwell GPUs. Therefore, SMH and SOXX can expect high returns in 2026 as well. However, valuation burden, tariff risks, and interest rate fluctuations must be continuously monitored. QQQ is expected to show relatively stable returns of around 20%.</p><p><strong>Final Advice:</strong> Master, all three ETFs have their advantages, but what is most important is <strong>'what matches your disposition and goals.'</strong> If you are so worried about losses that you cannot sleep, start with QQQ. If you aim for large returns but can accept the risks, add SMH. And never forget: <strong>diversified investment, long-term holding, and regular dollar-cost averaging</strong> are the only true paths for beginners to succeed in AI investing!</p></div></div><div class=post-tags-list><a href=/tags/ai-investing>#ai-investing</a>
