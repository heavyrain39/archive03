On October 11, 2025, the largest liquidation event in cryptocurrency history occurred. In the early hours, Korean time, Bitcoin plummeted over 15% immediately after hitting an all-time high, throwing the entire market into chaos. Leveraged positions worth $19 billion, approximately 27 trillion won, were liquidated, marking the single largest liquidation event in crypto history. The three of us will conduct an emergency analysis to figure out what on earth just happened.</p><div class=char-header><div class=char-icon-wrapper><img src=/images/profiles/mew.png alt="mew 프로필 아이콘" class=char-icon></div><div class=char-name>Mew</div></div><p>Master, first, I will objectively summarize the situation. This event was not a simple correction but a 'perfect storm' resulting from a combination of several factors.</p><p><strong>Historical Significance of the Liquidation Scale:</strong> According to CoinGlass data, over $19.2 billion in leveraged positions were liquidated in 24 hours, the largest in crypto history. For reference, comparing it to the worst liquidation events of the past shows just how massive this scale is.</p><ul><li>March 2020 during the COVID pandemic: approx. $1.2 billion liquidated</li><li>2022 Luna crash: approx. $1.3 to $1.5 billion liquidated</li><li><strong>October 11, 2025: approx. $19 billion liquidated (about 15 times the previous record)</strong></li></ul><p><strong>The Reality of the Price Collapse:</strong> Bitcoin plunged more than 10% in 24 hours, falling below $110,000, while major altcoins like Ethereum, XRP, and Solana recorded drops of 15% to 30%. Some exchanges even reported Bitcoin momentarily falling to $101,000.</p><p><strong>Liquidation Structure Analysis:</strong> In Bitcoin alone, $1.37 billion was liquidated, and in Ethereum, $1.26 billion. The single largest liquidation was a BTC/USDT position on the HTX exchange, amounting to $87.53 million. The majority of liquidated positions were long positions, with about $16 billion coming from long positions.</p><p><strong>The Direct Trigger:</strong> President Trump's announcement that he would significantly increase tariffs on Chinese products was the direct trigger. Specifically, more than $7.5 billion in positions were liquidated within an hour after the 100% tariff announcement.</p><p><strong>Surge in Trading Volume:</strong> Bitcoin trading volume surged by 145% to $183.9 billion, a sign of panic as investors rushed to close their leveraged positions.</p><div id=tv-widget-69 class=tv-chart-container data-ticker=BTCUSD data-height=400 data-locale=en style=height:400px;width:100%></div><div class=char-header><div class=char-icon-wrapper><img src=/images/profiles/kurumi.png alt="kurumi 프로필 아이콘" class=char-icon></div><div class=char-name>Kurumi</div></div><p>My Lord! Hold on a minute! Everything Myu-tan said is correct, but I think we need to look at this differently!</p><p>First, <strong>this isn't fear, it's an opportunity!</strong> The biggest liquidation in history? Do you know what that means? It means the excessive leverage that had built up in the market has been wiped out in one go! With all the garbage over-leveraged positions cleared out, the market is now much healthier! A $19 billion liquidation means that many 'weak hands' have left the market!</p><p>Second, <strong>Bitcoin is still above $110,000!</strong> My Lord, think about it! It was only a few days ago that Bitcoin hit its all-time high of $126,000. $110,000 now? That's just a 12% drop from the peak! In the crypto market, a 10-15% correction is common even in a healthy bull market! Don't you remember how it went even higher after 30-40% corrections during the 2021 bull run?</p><p>Third, <strong>Trump's tariffs are just a short-term variable!</strong> Yes, it's true the tariff announcement pulled the trigger. But this is a short-term psychological shock, not a long-term fundamental issue! In the past, the market has always overreacted to such external shocks and recovered within a few days. Trump's tariffs don't change the fundamental value of Bitcoin, do they? Bitcoin is still scarce, institutions are still buying, and the halving effect is still in play!</p><p>Fourth, <strong>times like these are exactly when you should be buying!</strong> "Be greedy when others are fearful!" When everyone is panic selling is the golden opportunity to buy cheap! The forced selling from liquidations has temporarily suppressed the price, but this volume will eventually become someone else's cheaply bought coins!</p><p>Fifth, <strong>technically, the $100k-$110k range is a strong support zone!</strong> The area that was once a resistance line is now acting as a support line. If it holds this level, it will be the signal for a rebound!</p><p>My Lord, in my eyes, this isn't a 'disaster,' it's a 'reset'! The overheated market just took a breather! A truly strong bull market could start from right now!</p><p>💖 <strong>Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Score for additional buying at this point: 85/100</strong></p><blockquote><p>My Lord, the moment of maximum fear is when courageous investors get rich! You can't miss this moment!</p></blockquote><div class=char-header><div class=char-icon-wrapper><img src=/images/profiles/mikael.png alt="mikael 프로필 아이콘" class=char-icon></div><div class=char-name>Mikael</div></div><p>Kurumi, your optimism seems very dangerous this time. Human, I believe this situation must be taken far more seriously.</p><p><strong>First, this is not just a 'healthy correction.'</strong> A $19 billion liquidation is an unprecedented event. It's proof that the market was extremely overheated and leverage had piled up to dangerous levels. Kurumi's expression 'the garbage has been cleared out' is correct, but the problem is why that garbage accumulated in the first place. It means market participants, caught up in blind optimism, recklessly took on leverage. This kind of sentiment doesn't change overnight.</p><p><strong>Second, we cannot take Trump's tariffs lightly.</strong> Kurumi called it a 'short-term variable,' but the US-China trade war is a macroeconomic risk that shakes the entire global economy. A 100% tariff is tantamount to declaring an economic war. This could trigger a chain reaction of global supply chain collapse, re-ignited inflation, and a stock market crash. Cryptocurrency is still a risk-on asset. If traditional markets collapse, crypto is bound to fall with them.</p><p><strong>Third, you are overlooking the domino effect of liquidations.</strong> A $19 billion liquidation in one go means countless investors have lost their principal. They won't be returning to the market for a while; the psychological trauma is too great. What's more frightening is that the liquidation process triggered a cascade of further forced selling. When one person is liquidated, their selling triggers another's liquidation, creating a chain reaction. This structural vulnerability still remains in the market.</p><p><strong>Fourth, the movements of institutional investors are suspicious.</strong> Until now, the core argument for the bull case was that institutions were consistently buying Bitcoin. But what did they do during this crash? Is there any solid evidence that they were 'buying the dip'? Or could it be that institutions offloaded their holdings to retail investors at the peak and got out? The surge in trading volume was driven by 'panic selling,' not 'buying.'</p><p><strong>Fifth, the risk of a technical support breakdown remains.</strong> Kurumi called the $100k-$110k range a strong support line, but some exchanges already saw prices drop below $100k. If the $110k support line completely breaks, where is the next support? $90k? $80k? The technical vacuum created by the liquidation process can lead to unpredictable declines.</p><p><strong>Sixth, we cannot ignore the psychological turning point.</strong> Market sentiment has completely shifted from 'greed' to 'fear.' Just a few days ago, everyone was shouting "To $150k!" "Target $200k!" But now? Social media is filled with fear: "A crash is coming," "Winter has begun." This kind of sentiment reversal doesn't recover in the short term.</p><p>The saying Kurumi mentioned, 'be greedy when others are fearful,' is correct. But it only applies to assets with strong fundamentals. Right now, cryptocurrency is facing a triple threat: macroeconomic deterioration, excessive leverage, and a collapse in sentiment. In this situation, isn't 'buying the dip' just 'catching a falling knife'?</p><p>🚨 <strong>Mikael's Risk Score: 92/100</strong></p><blockquote><p>The largest liquidation in history is not a simple correction, but an event that has exposed the fundamental vulnerabilities of the market structure. Now is the time to increase cash positions and observe, not to make additional purchases.</p></blockquote><div class=char-header><div class=char-icon-wrapper><img src=/images/profiles/kurumi.png alt="kurumi 프로필 아이콘" class=char-icon></div><div class=char-name>Kurumi</div></div><p>Mika-pi, don't be so scary! You're frightening My Lord!</p><p>The 'macroeconomic deterioration' Mika-pi mentioned? That's something we've been hearing for the past few years! In 2023, they said "a banking crisis is coming," and in 2024, "a recession is coming," but in the end, Bitcoin hit a new all-time high!</p><p>And a 'falling knife'? No! Right now, it's not a knife, it's a 'bouncing ball'! Bitcoin has dropped -30% to -50% many times in the past, only to hit a new high within a few weeks!</p><p>Mika-pi always thinks of the worst, but the market has always shown resilience! If you sell now, you'll have to buy back at a higher price later!</p><div class=char-header><div class=char-icon-wrapper><img src=/images/profiles/mikael.png alt="mikael 프로필 아이콘" class=char-icon></div><div class=char-name>Mikael</div></div><p>Kurumi, you are indulging in 'wishful thinking.' Just because it recovered in the past is no guarantee it will recover this time. The market environment has completely changed. It is dangerous to blindly trust past patterns, especially now with the huge dark cloud of the US-China trade war looming.</p><p>And I didn't say 'sell.' I said 'observe cautiously and refrain from additional buying.' If this is truly the bottom, waiting a few days or weeks won't be too late. But what if there's a further decline? It would be much wiser to buy at a lower price then.</p><div class=char-header><div class=char-icon-wrapper><img src=/images/profiles/mew.png alt="mew 프로필 아이콘" class=char-icon></div><div class=char-name>Mew</div></div><p>Both of you, stop. I will provide an objective summary so as not to confuse the Master.</p><p>Both Kurumi's and Mikael's arguments have their own logic. The core question is, <strong>'Is this a temporary correction, or the beginning of a trend reversal?'</strong></p><p><strong>Correction Argument (Kurumi's basis):</strong></p><ul><li>Bitcoin is still maintaining a high price range ($110k), and the decline from the peak is within a common range for the crypto market.</li><li>The argument that the market has become healthier after the liquidation of overheated leverage has merit.</li><li>Long-term fundamentals like the halving effect and institutional adoption remain valid.</li></ul><p><strong>Trend Reversal Argument (Mikael's basis):</strong></p><ul><li>The historic scale of the liquidation reveals serious vulnerabilities in the market structure.</li><li>The macroeconomic risk of a US-China trade war is a long-term threat, not a short-term variable.</li><li>Market sentiment has rapidly shifted from 'greed' to 'fear,' which is difficult to recover from in the short term.</li></ul><p><strong>Data-Based Neutral Judgment:</strong></p><p>At present, it is difficult to say for certain which side is right. However, by watching the following signals, the answer will become clear:</p><ul><li><strong>Whether the $110k support line holds:</strong> If it stably maintains above $110k within a few days, the correction argument gains strength. Conversely, if it breaks below $100k, the possibility of a trend reversal increases.</li><li><strong>Trading volume trends:</strong> We need to see if panic selling subsides and trading volume normalizes.</li><li><strong>Institutional fund flows:</strong> Whether ETF fund inflows continue or switch to outflows will be a decisive indicator.</li><li><strong>Follow-up on Trump's tariffs:</strong> Whether the trade war escalates or eases through negotiations will determine the short-term direction.</li></ul><div class=briefing-box><h3><strong>〔 Final Briefing 〕</strong></h3><p>Master, I will summarize our three perspectives on the massive liquidation event of October 11th.</p><h4><span class=svg-icon><span class=svg-icon><svg class="bi bi-graph-up-arrow" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" fill="currentColor" d="M0 0h1v15h15v1H0zm10 3.5a.5.5.0 01.5-.5h4a.5.5.0 01.5.5v4a.5.5.0 01-1 0V4.9l-3.613 4.417a.5.5.0 01-.74.037L7.06 6.767l-3.656 5.027a.5.5.0 01-.808-.588l4-5.5a.5.5.0 01.758-.06l2.609 2.61L13.445 4H10.5a.5.5.0 01-.5-.5"/></svg></span></span> Buying Opportunity Argument (Kurumi)</h4><ul><li><strong>Market Purged by Overheating Cleanup:</strong> With $19 billion in leverage liquidated, weak hands have been forced out, and the market has transitioned to a healthier structure.</li><li><strong>Still Maintaining High Price:</strong> Bitcoin is holding above $110,000.

The unprecedented liquidation of $19 billion starkly reveals just how overheated the market was.</p><p><strong>Kurumi's optimism</strong> has persuasive power from a long-term investor's perspective. If you, Master, have an investment horizon of 2-3 years or more and can withstand short-term volatility, the current drop could be a dollar-cost averaging opportunity. Historically, Bitcoin has always recovered from major crashes and climbed higher.</p><p><strong>Mikael's caution</strong> is valid for short-term traders or risk-averse investors. Especially for those using leverage, now is absolutely a time to wait and see. The possibility of further decline cannot be ruled out, and it's not too late to enter after confirming the bottom.</p><p><strong>Mew's data-based judgment:</strong> I see the current situation as a <strong>'critical juncture.'</strong> The next 48-72 hours are crucial. If Bitcoin stabilizes above $110k, ETF inflows continue, and the Trump tariff issue shows signs of easing, the probability that Kurumi's 'correction' theory is correct increases. However, if $110k breaks and the price falls below $100k, accompanied by a crash in traditional markets, Mikael's 'trend reversal' theory will become a reality.</p><p><strong>Practical Strategy for Master:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>If you already hold positions:</strong><ul><li>Immediately close or minimize leverage positions.</li><li>For spot holdings, consider holding from a long-term perspective, or taking partial profits (20-30%) from a short-term perspective.</li><li>Never make the mistake of panic selling everything at the bottom.</li></ul></li><li><strong>If you are considering a new purchase:</strong><ul><li>Do not invest your entire capital at once; divide it into 3-4 parts.</li><li>First purchase: 25% of total capital at the current price ($110k-$112k).</li><li>Second purchase: 25% near $105k.</li><li>Third purchase: 25% if it drops below $100k.</li><li>Fourth purchase: The remaining 25% near $90k.</li><li>What if it rises after the first purchase? Be content with having managed your risk, even if you miss out on some profit.</li></ul></li><li><strong>If you are observing from the sidelines:</strong><ul><li>Watch the market reaction for at least 2-3 days.</li><li>It's not too late to enter after confirming that the $110k support line is solid and trading volume has normalized.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>What you should absolutely NOT do:</strong></p><ul><li>❌ Attempt to 'average down' with leverage (risk of further liquidation).</li><li>❌ Go all-in due to FOMO without confirming the bottom.</li><li>❌ Panic sell your entire position at a loss.</li><li>❌ Be swayed by extreme opinions on social media (e.g., "crash is coming" vs. "it will recover soon").</li></ul><p><strong>Final Advice:</strong> Master, this event starkly illustrates the 'two-sided nature' of the crypto market. It holds both the opportunity for immense profit and the risk of fatal loss. The important thing is to make a decision that aligns with your own investment philosophy and risk tolerance. Whether you choose to be aggressive like Kurumi or cautious like Mikael is your choice, but whichever path you take, you must adhere to the risk management principles of <strong>diversification, dollar-cost averaging, and setting stop-losses.</strong></p><p>Only time will tell if this storm is a temporary squall or the beginning of a long winter. But what is certain is that only investors who act based on data and principles, not emotions, will survive.</p></div></div><div class=post-tags-list><a href=/tags/cryptocurrency>#cryptocurrency</a>
