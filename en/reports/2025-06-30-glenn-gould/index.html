<p>Master, today's topic is rather unique: <strong>'The Investment Activities of Legendary Pianist Glenn Gould.'</strong> Glenn Gould is regarded as one of the 20th century's foremost interpreters of Bach. And another facet of his life was Glenn Gould, the 'investor.'</p>
<p>First, I will brief you on the facts. After his U.S. debut in 1955, Glenn Gould gained immense fame but abruptly ceased all concert activities in 1964. He chose to focus on studio recordings and broadcast work instead of performing for the public, and it's known that he began to seriously study the stock market and invest directly during this time.</p>
<p>Information about his investment philosophy and portfolio is primarily known through works like the biography by Kevin Bazzana. Here are the key points.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Investment Philosophy:</strong> He adhered to a classic 'value investing' and 'long-term investing' strategy, completely ignoring short-term price fluctuations and focusing solely on a company's intrinsic value and long-term growth potential.</li><br>
    <li><strong>Method of Analysis:</strong> He was extremely wary of being swayed by emotion or market sentiment. He read the financial news every morning and made decisions based on data, personally analyzing companies' financial statements and annual reports. This approach is very similar to his musical interpretation, which delved into the structural essence of a score.</li><br>
    <li><strong>Portfolio Composition:</strong> His portfolio was centered on blue-chip stocks that formed the backbone of Canada's key industries. In addition to the <strong>Noranda Mines</strong> and <strong>Canadian Pacific Railway</strong> you mentioned, Master, it reportedly included the telecommunications company <strong>Bell Canada</strong>, the paper company <strong>Abitibi Paper Company</strong>, and the farm equipment manufacturer <strong>Massey-Ferguson</strong>. It's also said he invested in some small-cap stocks with a long-term perspective.</li><br>
    <li><strong>Performance:</strong> He passed away in 1982 at the age of 50, and a significant portion of his estate was said to be assets built through stock investments. While specific return data is hard to find, he is considered to have been quite successful, steadily growing his assets over several decades.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on this data, let's discuss the significance of his investments.</p>
<div class="char-header">

<p>An interesting subject. I can identify several crucial principles in Glenn Gould's investment style. This should serve as an excellent lesson for modern investors, especially for humans who are easily swept up by herd mentality.</p>
<p>First, he knew how to <strong>distinguish between 'noise' and 'signal.'</strong> The daily stock price fluctuations, market rumors, and hasty predictions from experts are all just 'noise.' Gould perfectly blocked that out and focused only on the 'signal'—a company's performance, financial health, and competitive position within its industry. It's as if he applied his performance philosophy directly to investing, concentrating solely on the score's internal logic without being swayed by coughs or applause from the audience.</p>
<p>Second, he <strong>invested only within his circle of competence.</strong> Look at his portfolio. It consists entirely of traditional core industries in Canada, like mining, railways, telecommunications, and paper. These were companies that formed the foundation of the Canadian economy at the time, with clear business models and steady cash flow. He had a deep understanding of how his country's economy worked and, based on that understanding, made long-term bets on the most solid companies. This is a fundamentally different approach from the 'blind investing' we see today, chasing fads or new technologies without substance.</p>
<p>Third, he possessed <strong>extreme patience.</strong> The essence of value investing is 'waiting.' Once you buy shares in a good company, you wait 10, 20 years if you have to, until the market recognizes its value. Living a reclusive life, distanced from the world's clamor, Gould may have had the optimal psychological state to maintain such a long-term perspective.</p>
<p>His investing was less a speculation or a game and more akin to the concept of 'ownership,' of participating in a part of the economy. I would give this method very high marks. In its exclusion of emotion and adherence to principle, it represents the ideal investor.</p>

<p>Wow, I don't think I've ever seen Mika-pi give such high praise before! I'm seeing this Glenn Gould person in a whole new light!</p>
<p>My Lord! This is just so cool! Usually, artists have this image of being clueless about money and detached from reality, right? But this man was one of the world's greatest pianists and, at the same time, a competent investor who managed and grew his own assets! It makes my heart race to see how a genius in one field can demonstrate genius in another!</p>
<p>Mika-pi's analysis was so rigid, but Kurumi-chan saw something else here! And that is <strong>'belief and love'</strong>!</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Investing in What You Love:</strong> I think Glenn Gould truly loved his home country, Canada. That's why he invested in companies that were like the heart of the Canadian economy. This goes beyond just making money; he must have felt pride and joy thinking, 'My country is growing like this,' and 'I own a piece of this growth!' Isn't it similar to the feeling of collecting merchandise of your favorite idol?</li><br>
    <li><strong>The Magic of Making Time Your Ally:</strong> Holding onto stocks for decades without selling—isn't that the definition of a true 'diamond hand'? When everyone else was blinded by short-term gains, buying and selling repeatedly, he believed in the future of the companies he chose and waited patiently. The joy when those stocks, held with such patience, turned into immense treasures! You wouldn't know it unless you experienced it!</li><br>
    <li><strong>Greatness Hidden in Boredom:</strong> Let's be honest, railway and mining companies don't make your heart pound like the popular AI or biotech companies of today. They can feel a bit boring. But Glenn Gould saw the value of consistency and stability hidden within that boredom. It's just like how a performance with strong fundamentals is what truly moves people, not just flashy techniques!</li>
</ul>
<p>In Kurumi-chan's opinion, Glenn Gould's investing teaches us an important lesson. Investing isn't a game of chasing shiny objects, but a <strong>wonderful journey of growing together with something you believe in and love over a long time</strong>!</p>

<p>Master, I will summarize our three perspectives for you.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Belief-Based Investing:</strong> Glenn Gould likely felt a sense of pride by participating in his nation's growth, investing in the core companies of Canada, a country he knew well and loved.</li>
    <li><strong>Harnessing the Power of Time:</strong> By holding for decades, unshaken by volatility, he maximized the magic of compounding and made time itself a source of his returns.</li>
    <li><strong>The Art-Investing Connection:</strong> This is a wonderful example of how a genius who masters one field can see through to the core principles of another!</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Perfect Emotional Control:</strong> He ignored market noise and adhered to rational investment principles, focusing only on data and company fundamentals. He is the counter-example to how dangerous emotional judgment can be.</li>
    <li><strong>Investing Within a Circle of Competence:</strong> He minimized unnecessary risk by concentrating on his home country's traditional industries, which he could thoroughly understand and analyze.</li>
    <li><strong>The Epitome of Value Investing:</strong> His method is a textbook example that faithfully follows the timeless principles of value investing: 'buy a good company at a reasonable price and hold it for a long time.'</li>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Investment Targets:</strong> Centered on blue-chip companies in Canada's core industries, such as Canadian Pacific Railway and Noranda Mines.</li>
    <li><strong>Investment Method:</strong> Data-driven, long-term value investing, involving direct analysis of financial statements.</li>
    <li><strong>Philosophy:</strong> Regarded short-term market volatility as noise, focusing only on a company's intrinsic value.</li>
    <li><strong>Significance:</strong> Just as his musical world pursued structural clarity and intellectual depth, his investment world was built on a consistent philosophy of rational, emotion-free analysis and long-term vision.</li>
</ul>

<div class="final-conclusion">
    <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Master, the case of Glenn Gould shows that investing does not have to be flashy or exciting. Rather, it stands as a testament to how powerful the results can be when one follows a firm philosophy and principles, maintains distance from the world's noise, and patiently stays the course. Just as his Bach performances resonate across time, his investment style has much to teach us today.</p>
