The horizontal lines drawn on a chart, so-called 'support' and 'resistance.' Looking at them, they can seem like a secret map to the future. But how reliable are they really? The three of us will debate the credibility of this fundamental concept in technical analysis.</p><div class=char-header><div class=char-icon-wrapper><img src=/images/profiles/mew.png alt="mew 프로필 아이콘" class=char-icon></div><div class=char-name>Mew</div></div><p>Master, first, I will brief you on what 'Support' and 'Resistance' are from a data perspective. This isn't magic; it can be described as the <strong>footprint of collective psychology</strong>.</p><ul><li><strong>Support Level:</strong> This is a price level where a stock, after falling, tends to stop or bounce back up. At this point, the buying pressure from those who think 'it's cheap enough now' becomes stronger than the selling pressure from those who think 'it will fall further,' causing demand to outpace supply. It is formed by connecting previous low points where the price has repeatedly hit and rebounded.</li><li><strong>Resistance Level:</strong> This is a price level where a stock, after rising, tends to stop or fall back down. At this point, the selling pressure from those who think 'it's too expensive now' (profit-taking or loss-cutting) becomes stronger than the buying pressure from those who think 'it will rise further,' causing supply to exceed demand. It is formed by connecting previous high points where breakouts have repeatedly failed.</li></ul><p>The psychological background for the formation of these lines is simple. For example, let's assume a stock fell from $100 to $80 and then rose back to $100.</p><ul><li>People who regretted not buying at $80 will place buy orders when the price approaches $80 again, thinking, 'This is my chance!' (forming a support line).</li><li>People who regretted not selling at $100 will place sell orders when the price approaches $100 again, thinking, 'I'm breaking even!' (forming a resistance line).</li></ul><p>The memories and emotions of these investors converge at specific price points, creating support and resistance. The important thing is that a broken resistance line tends to become a support line, and a broken support line tends to become a resistance line.</p><div class=char-header><div class=char-icon-wrapper><img src=/images/profiles/kurumi.png alt="kurumi 프로필 아이콘" class=char-icon></div><div class=char-name>Kurumi</div></div><p>Myu-tan's explanation is so stiff! My Lord, these aren't just lines; they're like a <strong>treasure map for reading the market's psychology</strong>! I absolutely adore these lines!</p><p>First, it's a <strong>'Self-fulfilling Prophecy'</strong>! Countless investors worldwide are looking at the same charts and drawing the same support and resistance lines. As a result, buy orders actually flood in at the support line where everyone thinks, "It will probably bounce back here," and sell orders flood in at the resistance line where everyone thinks, "It will probably get blocked here." It's a magical event where the prophecy comes true! Devilish!</p><p>Second, knowing this makes it <strong>much easier to time your trades!</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Near the support line:</strong> The price has come down to the support line? It could be a 'bargain sale' opportunity! If you bravely buy here, you can make a profit when it rebounds!</li><li><strong>Near the resistance line:</strong> The price has hit the resistance line? It's a signal to take profits without getting greedy!</li><li><strong>Breaking the resistance line:</strong> If it breaks through a strong resistance line? That's the signal for a new era! That's when you should chase the trend and aim for a bigger rise!</li></ul><p>Of course, it's not 100%, but it's a powerful weapon that allows you to play a game with a much higher win rate than investing without any criteria! This is a work of art created by the collective anxiety and greed of market participants!</p><p>💖 <strong>Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Score: 85/100</strong></p><blockquote><p>A chart is a picture drawn by all market participants together! If you can read the flow of the picture, you can see the money!</p></blockquote><div class=char-header><div class=char-icon-wrapper><img src=/images/profiles/mikael.png alt="mikael 프로필 아이콘" class=char-icon></div><div class=char-name>Mikael</div></div><p>Kurumi, have you ever considered that your treasure map might actually be a mirage? Human, blindly trusting those lines is a very dangerous act. I would like to point out a few fatal traps.</p><p>First, there is the <strong>trap of subjectivity.</strong> Support and resistance lines are not as clear-cut as if measured with a ruler. One person might connect recent lows, while another includes lows from further in the past. It also changes depending on whether you use the candle's body or its wick as a reference. It's a perfect tool for falling into 'Confirmation Bias,' where you draw the line however you want to see it and justify your investment decisions.</p><p>Second, <strong>this is all just past data.</strong> Technical analysis is based on the assumption that past price movements will repeat in the future. However, if unexpected news that changes the market's fundamental value breaks (e.g., earnings announcements, interest rate hikes, war, etc.), past support and resistance lines become as useless as scrap paper and are easily broken.</p><p>Third, there is the trap of a <strong>'False Breakout.'</strong> Market makers exploit this mass psychology. They intentionally push the price just above a resistance line to induce retail investors to chase the stock, then dump all their shares, causing the price to crash. Conversely, they might slightly break a support line to scoop up the shares of panicked retail investors who are selling at a loss, and then drive the price up.</p><p>These lines are not a crystal ball for predicting the future. It is wise to use them merely as a reference, thinking, 'A psychological battle might be fierce at this price level,' and as a standard for <strong>risk management</strong>. For example, for establishing a principle like, 'If the support line breaks, my judgment was wrong, so I will cut my losses.'</p><p>🚨 <strong>Mikael's Risk Score: 70/100</strong></p><blockquote><p>Past footprints do not guarantee the future path.
