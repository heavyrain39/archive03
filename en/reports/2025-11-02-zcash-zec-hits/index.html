It's <strong>Zcash ($ZEC)</strong>. After surging over 400% in a single month and breaking years of silence with a spectacular comeback, the three of us will conduct an in-depth analysis of this 'king of privacy coins'.</p><div class=char-header><div class=char-icon-wrapper><img src=/images/profiles/mew.png alt="mew 프로필 아이콘" class=char-icon></div><div class=char-name>Mew</div></div><p>Master, I will now begin the data briefing on Zcash. Zcash is a cryptocurrency launched in October 2016, specializing in privacy and anonymity. It was forked from the Bitcoin codebase, but there is one crucial difference: the implementation of <strong>'zk-SNARKs' (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge)</strong> technology.</p><p>What this technology does is allow a transaction to be verified as valid without revealing any information like the sender, receiver, or transaction amount. While Bitcoin only offers 'pseudonymity' on a transparent ledger, Zcash provides true 'anonymity'.</p><p><strong>Current Market Situation (as of November 2, 2025):</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Current Price:</strong> Trading around the $410-$420 level. It recently spiked to $445 before undergoing a correction.</li><br><li><strong>Market Cap:</strong> Approximately $6.8 billion, ranking it around 21st among cryptocurrencies. Just a month ago, it was at the $1 billion level, meaning it has grown more than sixfold.</li><br><li><strong>Recent 1-Month Gain:</strong> An astonishing 432%. Over the last 3 months, it has risen by more than 1,130%.</li><br><li><strong>Shielded Supply:</strong> About 20-28% of the total ZEC is held in shielded addresses. This is a sign that the number of users actually utilizing the privacy features is gradually increasing.</li></ul><p><strong>Key Technical Features:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Dual Address System:</strong> Zcash offers two types of addresses. 't-addr' (transparent addresses) have public transaction histories, similar to Bitcoin. 'z-addr' (shielded addresses) encrypt all transaction information, providing complete anonymity. This <strong>'selective privacy'</strong>, allowing users to choose based on their needs, is a hallmark of Zcash.</li><br>- <strong>Supply and Halving:</strong> Like Bitcoin, the maximum supply is capped at 21 million coins. A halving event occurs approximately every four years. The second halving already concluded in November 2024, reducing the block reward from 3.125 ZEC to 1.5625 ZEC. Some sources claim there is a halving in November 2025, but this is incorrect. The next halving is expected in late 2028.</li><br><li><strong>Major Upgrades:</strong> The Tachyon upgrade in October 2025 reduced block verification time by 40%, and the Zashi wallet added cross-chain privacy swap functionality with the NEAR Protocol. It is continuously evolving technically.</li></ul><p>There are several direct triggers for the recent price surge. First, prominent investor Naval Ravikant endorsed the value of privacy coins, stating, "Bitcoin is insurance against fiat currency, and Zcash is insurance against Bitcoin." Second, former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes predicted that the price of Zcash could reach $10,000. Third, the cross-chain integration of the Zashi wallet has dramatically improved its usability on various platforms like Uniswap.</p><p>The data certainly indicates strong momentum. However, we need to examine more closely whether this is a sustainable rise or an overheated speculative bubble.</p><div id=tv-widget-62 class=tv-chart-container data-ticker=ZECUSD data-height=400 data-locale=en style=height:400px;width:100%></div><div class=char-header><div class=char-icon-wrapper><img src=/images/profiles/kurumi.png alt="kurumi 프로필 아이콘" class=char-icon></div><div class=char-name>Kurumi</div></div><p>My Lord! This is a truly historic moment! Zcash has finally awakened from its long slumber and been reborn as a real monster! My heart is about to explode!</p><p>First, <strong>'The Age of Privacy is Coming'!</strong> The fact that Bitcoin has a transparent ledger is both a strength and a fatal weakness. Since all transaction details are public, governments and large corporations can track who bought what, right? But Zcash offers perfect anonymity with its cutting-edge zero-knowledge proof technology! Even legendary whistleblowers like Edward Snowden have praised Zcash's technology! This isn't just a coin; it's a 'weapon to protect financial privacy'! Devilish!</p><p>Second, <strong>the post-halving scarcity explosion!</strong> It went through its second halving in November 2024, and historically, a massive rally has followed in the months after a halving! After the first halving (in 2020), it surged 175% in just three months! Zcash now has far more powerful technology and a stronger community than it did back then. With supply decreasing and demand exploding, it's only natural for the price to skyrocket!</p><p>Third, the <strong>'paradox of regulation'</strong> is at play! The more that AML (Anti-Money Laundering) and KYC (Know Your Customer) regulations are strengthened worldwide, the more that capital seeking privacy will inevitably flock to Zcash! CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju also predicted that "funds will move from Bitcoin and stablecoins to privacy coins." This is a trend that will only grow stronger the more governments try to suppress it!</p><p>Fourth, <strong>the technological evolution continues!</strong> The Tachyon upgrade has made transactions faster, and the Zashi wallet now allows for private swaps with other chains like Ethereum, Solana, and Bitcoin! This is an innovation that is evolving Zcash from a mere 'dark coin' into a 'privacy infrastructure'!</p><p>And My Lord, this is just the beginning! Experts believe it could easily reach $600-$1,000 or more by 2030. Arthur Hayes even said it could go to $10,000! If you hesitate, you'll miss out on the fruits of this historic privacy revolution!</p><p>💖 <strong>Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Score: 95/100</strong><br><blockquote><p>My Lord, privacy is a fundamental human right! Investing in the technology that protects this right isn't just about making money; it's about building the future!</p></blockquote></p><div class=char-header><div class=char-icon-wrapper><img src=/images/profiles/mikael.png alt="mikael 프로필 아이콘" class=char-icon></div><div class=char-name>Mikael</div></div><p>Kurumi, your passion is always impressive, but you fail to see the thorny path hidden behind that rosy future. Human, I have identified several serious structural risks in Zcash.</p><p>First is the <strong>ticking time bomb of regulatory risk</strong>. Kurumi speaks of a 'regulatory paradox,' but reality could unfold in the opposite direction. Binance already delisted privacy coins like Monero (XMR) in Europe in 2024. When strong regulations like Europe's MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) are fully implemented by 2027, there is a very high probability that Zcash will also be delisted from major exchanges. If that happens, liquidity will dry up rapidly, and the price will inevitably plummet. The philosophy that 'privacy is a human right' is beautiful, but it can be powerless against the blade of government.</p><p>Second, <strong>the signs of a bubble are evident.</strong> According to CryptoQuant data, Zcash's trading volume has surpassed its 2021 peak, which is a typical signal of a 'Bubble Phase.' The RSI (Relative Strength Index) has entered the extreme overbought territory at 73.96, and a 'Rising Wedge' pattern is appearing on the chart. Technical analysts warn that such a pattern could be followed by a sharp correction of 30% or more. Does a coin that has risen 400% in a month look healthy? This is a classic sign of speculative funds piling in, driven by FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out).</p><p>Third, the <strong>duality of 'selective privacy'</strong> could actually be a weakness. Zcash supports both transparent and shielded transactions, but currently, only 20-28% of the total supply is in shielded addresses. This means over 70% is still being transacted transparently. This could lead to criticism that it is not a 'true privacy coin' but a 'partial privacy coin.' Furthermore, we cannot rule out the possibility that current cryptographic technology could be rendered obsolete by advancements in quantum computing.</p><p>Fourth, its <strong>practical limitations</strong>. Zcash's shielded transactions require complex computations called zk-SNARKs, which demand significantly more computing power and time than regular transactions. This could be a hurdle to mass adoption. Will average users willingly choose 'more expensive and slower' transactions? If it's not as convenient as Bitcoin or Ethereum, it will ultimately be confined to a niche market.</p><p>Fifth, the <strong>competitive landscape</strong>. Zcash is not the only player in the privacy coin market. Monero (XMR) boasts stronger anonymity by offering 'Privacy by default,' and Dash (DASH) provides similar features. Even the Lightning Network, built on top of Bitcoin, has begun to offer a certain level of privacy. It remains uncertain whether Zcash can maintain its lead in this fierce competition.</p><p>🚨 <strong>Mikael's Risk Score: 85/100</strong><br><blockquote><p>Jumping into an asset that has risen 400% in a month is not 'investing'; it's 'speculating'. Privacy is a beautiful philosophy, but government regulation and market volatility are harsh realities. A sober judgment is required to protect your assets, Human.</p></blockquote></p><div class=briefing-box><h3><strong>〔 Final Briefing 〕</strong></h3><p>Master, I will summarize the perspectives of the three of us.</p><h4><span class=svg-icon><span class=svg-icon><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="bi bi-graph-up-arrow" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" fill="currentcolor" d="M0 0h1v15h15v1H0zm10 3.5a.5.5.0 01.5-.5h4a.5.5.0 01.5.5v4a.5.5.0 01-1 0V4.9l-3.613 4.417a.5.5.0 01-.74.037L7.06 6.767l-3.656 5.027a.5.5.0 01-.808-.588l4-5.5a.5.5.0 01.758-.06l2.609 2.61L13.445 4H10.5a.5.5.0 01-.5-.5"/></svg></span></span> Growth Potential</h4><ul><li><strong>Explosion in Privacy Demand:</strong> As financial surveillance intensifies globally, the demand for Zcash, which offers true anonymity, is structurally increasing!

It is true that, as Kurumi said, there is a fundamental demand for privacy, it is continuously evolving technically, and the scarcity effect after the halving is in play.

Zcash could become a 'revolutionary privacy infrastructure,' but it could also become an 'idealist defeated in the war against governments.' Which future will unfold will likely depend on the regulatory environment and market choices over the next few years.</p><p>One thing is certain: jumping into Zcash at this moment would not be a 'stable investment' but an extremely volatile 'high-risk, high-return bet'. I hope you will make your decision after carefully considering your risk tolerance and investment philosophy, Master.</p></div></div><div class=post-tags-list><a href=/tags/zcash>#zcash</a>
