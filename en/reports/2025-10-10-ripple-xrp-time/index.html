After its legal battle with the SEC effectively concluded in 2024, its price surged, and it has continued to show volatile movements into 2025. Should you buy XRP at this point, or is it time to exit at a high? The three of us will delve deep into this question.</p><div class=char-header><div class=char-icon-wrapper><img src=/images/profiles/mew.png alt="mew 프로필 아이콘" class=char-icon></div><div class=char-name>Mew</div></div><p>Master, I'll begin with an objective data briefing on XRP's current situation.</p><p><strong>Current Price and Market Status:</strong> XRP is currently trading at around $2.99, with a market capitalization of $179.7 billion. As of early October, it has formed a strong support line around $2.80, and forecasts suggest that if it maintains the support cluster of $2.96-$2.98, a rise to $3.00-$3.02 is possible.</p><p><strong>SEC Lawsuit Outcome:</strong> This is the most crucial fundamental for XRP. In August 2024, the court ruled that XRP is not a security, and Ripple agreed to pay a civil penalty of $125 million. In August 2025, both parties agreed to drop their appeals and split the $125 million held in escrow, with $50 million going to the SEC and the rest returned to Ripple. This means the four-year period of legal uncertainty has effectively ended.</p><p><strong>Price Outlook:</strong> Market analysts' opinions are quite optimistic. Some analysts and AI prediction models forecast that XRP could reach $5.05 by the end of 2025, with some even suggesting a potential rise to $26.50 by 2030. Geoffrey Kendrick of Standard Chartered expects XRP to reach $12.50 by 2028, implying a 325% upside from the current price.</p><p><strong>Technical Analysis:</strong> In the short term, some forecasts suggest a slight decline to $2.79 by October 14 and $2.78 by November 8. At this point, opinions from a technical perspective are mixed.</p><div id=tv-widget-69 class=tv-chart-container data-ticker=XRPUSD data-height=400 data-locale=en style=height:400px;width:100%></div><div class=char-header><div class=char-icon-wrapper><img src=/images/profiles/kurumi.png alt="kurumi 프로필 아이콘" class=char-icon></div><div class=char-name>Kurumi</div></div><p>My Lord! Did you see Myu-tan's data? This is a golden opportunity! Let me tell you exactly why you should buy XRP right now, devilishly so!</p><p>First, the legal uncertainty has been completely eliminated! The four-year lawsuit that weighed down XRP is over! The court clearly declared, "XRP is not a security!" Do you know how huge that is? Previously, U.S. exchanges delisted or restricted trading of XRP. But now, all those restrictions are gone! Major exchanges like Coinbase have started fully supporting XRP again, and institutional investors can now enter with confidence!</p><p>Second, there's tremendous upside potential left! $3 right now? That's just the beginning! A global investment bank like Standard Chartered has set a 2028 price target of $12.50! That means it could rise more than four times from the current price! Some long-term forecasts even mention $26 by 2030! If you miss out on an asset with this kind of growth potential now, when will you get another chance?</p><p>Third, it's a cryptocurrency with clear real-world use cases! XRP isn't just 'digital gold' like Bitcoin. It's actually being used in Ripple's cross-border payment system! Banks and financial institutions worldwide are using RippleNet to achieve faster and cheaper international transfers! This is a solid fundamental backed by real business demand!</p><p>Fourth, market sentiment has completely turned around! During the SEC lawsuit, everyone avoided XRP, but now it has become a symbol of victory! Do you realize how powerful the title of being the only major cryptocurrency to beat the SEC in court is? This is a historic event that has given the entire crypto market hope that it's possible to fight back against regulation and win!</p><p>My Lord, the $2.80 support line is solid, and technically, if we can just break through $3 decisively, the upward momentum could really take off! This very moment is the golden time to get on the XRP bus!</p><p>💖 <strong>Kurumi's Heart-o-Meter Score: 92/100</strong></p><blockquote><p>My Lord, with its legal risks gone, XRP is now ready to spread its wings! You must act now for your future wealth! Devilish!</p></blockquote><div class=char-header><div class=char-icon-wrapper><img src=/images/profiles/mikael.png alt="mikael 프로필 아이콘" class=char-icon></div><div class=char-name>Mikael</div></div><p>Kurumi, you always see only the glittering surface. Human, I believe a much more cautious approach is needed for XRP. You must see the shadows hidden behind the positive factors Kurumi mentioned.</p><p><strong>First, you must face the limits of the legal victory.</strong> Yes, Ripple achieved a 'partial victory' against the SEC. But it wasn't a complete win. The court ruled that sales to institutional investors still violated securities laws, and Ripple paid a $125 million fine. Furthermore, a permanent injunction is in effect, restricting direct sales to institutions. This is far from the 'complete freedom' Kurumi speaks of.</p><p><strong>Second, the risk of valuation.</strong> XRP currently has a market cap of $179.7 billion, ranking it among the top 3-4 in the crypto market. It's already quite large. A fourfold increase to $12 would mean its market cap would exceed $700 billion. Can its actual adoption rate and usage justify this? Analysts' rosy forecasts have been made for countless cryptocurrencies in the past, but most have not materialized.</p><p><strong>Third, the issue of Ripple's large XRP holdings.</strong> Ripple Labs still holds a significant portion of the total XRP supply. If they continuously release this supply into the market, it creates structural resistance to price appreciation. There have been several instances in the past where Ripple's quarterly XRP sales acted as downward pressure on the price. This is a fundamental difference from the decentralized ownership structures of Bitcoin or Ethereum.</p><p><strong>Fourth, the overestimation of real-world use cases.</strong> Kurumi emphasizes RippleNet, but what banks mostly use is Ripple's 'software solution,' not the XRP token itself. This means it's often not directly linked to the demand for XRP. In fact, many partner banks do not use XRP as a bridge currency. This acts as a fundamental limitation on the token's value appreciation.</p><p><strong>Fifth, technical vulnerability.</strong> Short-term forecasts also suggest a potential decline. $3 is a strong psychological resistance level, and if it fails to break through and the $2.80 support line collapses, a sharp correction could follow. Considering the volatility of the crypto market, there's a significant risk that buying now could be buying at the top.</p><p>Kurumi shouts for $12, but I believe now might be the time to consider taking partial profits. The good news of the legal uncertainty being resolved is likely already priced in to a large extent. This could be a classic 'Buy the rumor, sell the news' scenario.</p><p>🚨 <strong>Mikael's Risk Score: 68/100</strong></p><blockquote><p>Legal risk has decreased, but valuation risk and structural supply pressure remain. A strategy of taking short-term profits and waiting for a correction may be wiser.</p></blockquote><div class=char-header><div class=char-icon-wrapper><img src=/images/profiles/kurumi.png alt="kurumi 프로필 아이콘" class=char-icon></div><div class=char-name>Kurumi</div></div><p>Hold on, Mika-pi! Isn't that a bit too harsh? XRP is riding high on the momentum right after its legal victory!</p><p>First, your use of the term 'partial victory' is biased in itself! The most important thing is the court's clear ruling that "XRP itself is not a security!" The restriction on direct sales to institutions is an issue with Ripple's business model, not the legal status of the XRP token itself! Now all investors can trade XRP as a digital asset, not a security!</p><p>Second, the market cap argument is limited in the crypto market! People used to say a "$1 trillion market cap is impossible" for Bitcoin, but now it has surpassed $2 trillion! If XRP becomes the core infrastructure for the global remittance market, capturing just 10% of the multi-trillion dollar international transfer market could justify a much higher value than it has now!</p><p>And Ripple's XRP holdings? That's actually proof of stable supply management! Ripple releases a fixed amount into the market each month through an escrow system, providing a predictable supply schedule! It's not unplanned dumping, it's strategic liquidity management!</p><p>As for real-world use cases, banks only using the software? That's a transitional phenomenon! The adoption of XRP-based solutions like ODL (On-Demand Liquidity) is continuously growing! Over time, more financial institutions will directly experience the speed and cost-efficiency of XRP!</p><p>Mika-pi, selling now and waiting is completely missing the opportunity! In the crypto market, "waiting for a correction" is just a shortcut to buying at an even higher price!</p><div class=char-header><div class=char-icon-wrapper><img src=/images/profiles/mikael.png alt="mikael 프로필 아이콘" class=char-icon></div><div class=char-name>Mikael</div></div><p>Kurumi, I acknowledge your passion, but do you know why that optimism is dangerous? It's because you are trapped in 'confirmation bias'.</p><p>A 10% share of the international remittance market? That's close to a fantasy. SWIFT is a global standard with a 70-year history, and central banks worldwide are developing their own CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies). The probability of Ripple breaking through this massive established system in the short term is very low. The 'what ifs' you speak of have a slim chance of becoming reality.</p><p>And I didn't say 'sell.' I said, 'take partial profits and look for a re-entry opportunity.' This is a basic principle of risk management. Cryptocurrencies are more than 10 times as volatile as stocks. In an upward momentum phase like now, everyone feels like a genius, but when a correction comes, a -50% drop in a week is possible in this market.</p><p>Kurumi, you are consumed by the 'Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO).' But true investment must be based on cold, hard probability calculations, not fear.</p><div class=char-header><div class=char-icon-wrapper><img src=/images/profiles/mew.png alt="mew 프로필 아이콘" class=char-icon></div><div class=char-name>Mew</div></div><p>Both of you, stop. An emotional confrontation won't help the Master. I will summarize objectively.</p><p>Kurumi's and Mikael's arguments clash because they are based on different premises: <strong>'investment horizon'</strong> and <strong>'risk appetite'</strong>.</p><p><strong>Kurumi's Perspective (Long-Term Bull Case):</strong> She focuses on long-term fundamentals like the removal of legal uncertainty, the increased potential for institutional entry, and expanding real-world use cases. If you, Master, are planning a long-term investment of 2-3 years or more and can tolerate volatility, Kurumi's logic is quite persuasive. It's also worth considering that the $12.50 price target from investment banks like Standard Chartered is not a baseless number but a quantitative analysis based on certain scenarios.</p><p><strong>Mikael's Perspective (Short-Term Caution):</strong> He focuses on the immediate buying risks, such as the possibility that the legal victory is already priced in, the risk of a short-term technical correction, and Ripple's supply pressure. If you, Master, have a short-term trading perspective or feel anxious about high volatility, Mikael's warning is also valid.</p><p><strong>Data-Driven Neutral Analysis:</strong> XRP is currently at a clear crossroads. $3 is a psychologically and technically important resistance level. If it clearly breaks through and establishes support, it could signal the start of the bullish scenario Kurumi described. Conversely, if the $2.80 support line breaks, the correction phase Mikael warned about could become a reality.</p><p>The important thing is that there is no 'right answer' in this market. The strategy must change depending on your investment goals, capital size, and psychological risk tolerance, Master.</p><div class=briefing-box><h3><strong>〔 Final Briefing 〕</strong></h3><p>Master, I

class=final-conclusion><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Master, the decision to buy or sell XRP depends on two key variables: your <strong>'investment horizon'</strong> and <strong>'risk appetite'</strong>.</p><p><strong>Buying may be suitable if:</strong></p><ul><li>You have a long-term investment perspective of 2-3 years or more.</li><li>You can psychologically tolerate the high volatility inherent in crypto (-30% to -50% corrections).</li><li>You believe in Ripple's remittance infrastructure expansion scenario and see the removal of legal risk as the true beginning of its value realization.</li></ul><p><strong>Selling or holding may be suitable if:</strong></p><ul><li>You have a short-term trading perspective or aim to realize profits within 6 months.</li><li>You believe the current price has already risen sufficiently and want to re-enter at a lower price during a correction.</li><li>You have a low tolerance for volatility or cannot afford to lose your principal investment.</li></ul><p><strong>Compromise - A Split Trading Strategy:</strong></p><p>If you are hesitating between the two, Master, you could consider the following strategies:</p><ul><li><strong>If you currently hold XRP:</strong> Consider taking partial profits on 30-40% of your holdings at the current price (approx. $3.00), hold the rest for the long term, and look for opportunities to buy more in the $2.60-$2.70 range.</li><li><strong>If you are considering a new purchase:</strong> Instead of investing your full amount at once, use a dollar-cost averaging strategy: invest 30-40% at the current price, another 30-40% if it tests the $2.80 support, and the remainder if it drops further ($2.50-$2.60).</li><li><strong>Use technical signals:</strong> If the price clearly breaks through $3.00-$3.02 and holds for a few days (a successful retest), consider buying more. Conversely, if the $2.80 support line breaks, temporarily step back and look to re-enter at a lower price.</li></ul><p><strong>Final Advice:</strong> XRP is clearly an asset where 'opportunity' and 'risk' coexist. Both Kurumi's optimism and Mikael's caution have their logical grounds. The most important thing is to make a decision that fits your own investment philosophy and financial situation. Never invest just because 'everyone else is buying' or due to FOMO. Remember that setting your own clear entry/exit criteria and sticking to those rules is the only way to survive in the crypto market.</p></div></div><div class=char-header><div class=char-icon-wrapper><img src=/images/profiles/kurumi.png alt="kurumi 프로필 아이콘" class=char-icon></div><div class=char-name>Kurumi</div></div><p>Myu-tan! I'll admit that compromise is a good one! I wasn't saying to go all-in, you know. But one thing is for sure!</p><p>Completely ignoring XRP now is making the same mistake as those who heard about Bitcoin in 2010 and said, "What's that?" and ignored it! Of course, there are risks. But managing those risks while taking a position is the attitude of a true investor!</p><p>My Lord, I recommend allocating at least 5-10% of your portfolio to XRP to participate in this historic moment! Don't regret it later when it surpasses $12, thinking, "I should have at least followed Myu-tan's split-buying strategy then!"</p><div class=char-header><div class=char-icon-wrapper><img src=/images/profiles/mikael.png alt="mikael 프로필 아이콘" class=char-icon></div><div class=char-name>Mikael</div></div><p>Kurumi, putting Bitcoin and XRP on the same level is a logical leap. Bitcoin was the first decentralized cryptocurrency, whereas XRP is a token issued and managed by a centralized company. They are fundamentally different assets.</p><p>However, I agree with Mew's compromise. Human, if you decide to invest in XRP, never go 'all-in.' It is wise to keep cryptocurrencies to no more than 5-15% of your portfolio, and within that, allocate only a portion to XRP. And be sure to set a stop-loss. For example, set a rule in advance to liquidate your position if the price drops below $2.50.</p><p>Invest with rules, not emotions. That is the only way to protect your assets in this highly volatile market.</p><div class=char-header><div class=char-icon-wrapper><img src=/images/profiles/mew.png alt="mew 프로필 아이콘" class=char-icon></div><div class=char-name>Mew</div></div><p>Master, both of them are making valid points. Kurumi emphasizes the importance of 'seizing opportunities,' while Mikael stresses the necessity of 'risk management.' A true investor is someone who can balance these two.</p><p>Let me tell you one last thing. The key variables that will determine XRP's future movements are as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Technical Levels:</strong> Keep an eye on whether it breaks $3.00 and holds the $2.80 support line.</li><li><strong>Macroeconomics:</strong> The US Fed's interest rate policy and global liquidity flows. Continued rate cuts would be a tailwind for risk assets like cryptocurrencies as a whole.</li><li><strong>Regulatory Environment:</strong> Monitor the progress of additional crypto regulation bills in the US and changes in other countries' regulatory stances on XRP.</li><li><strong>Actual Adoption Rate:</strong> Regularly check for news on RippleNet partnership expansions and trends in ODL transaction volume.</li></ul><p>It's important to continuously update your own investment thesis while observing these variables comprehensively. Remember that investing is not a one-time decision but a living process of continuous monitoring and adjustment.</p><p>Master, I hope our discussion has been helpful. Whatever decision you make, if it's based on data and your own clear logic, it's the best decision. I wish you the best of luck!</p><div class=post-tags-list><a href=/tags/ripple>#ripple</a>
